",9,"Forrest Gump is a movie that tells the story of a man named Forrest who faces many challenges throughout his life, including disabilities, bullying, war, and the death of a loved one. Despite these hardships, Forrest approaches life with a positive attitude and a light-hearted spirit. The movie celebrates the importance of accepting oneself and one's limitations, while also recognizing that the most essential things in life come from the heart, not the mind.The film is directed by Robert Zemeckis, who uses advanced visual effects to bring the story to life. The script is well-written, and the soundtrack is rich and vibrant. Tom Hanks delivers a magnificent performance as Forrest, and his character's simple yet profound statement, ""I'm not a smart man, but I know what love is,"" sums up the movie's message perfectly.Forrest Gump takes the audience on a journey through thirty years of American history, all seen from Forrest's unique perspective. The movie teaches us to take life lightly, to glide over things without letting them weigh us down. Forrest's natural optimism and unique approach to life remind us that life is a precious gift, and we should cherish it every day.",4 January 2024

",10,"""Schindler's List"" is a profound testament to the horrors of the Holocaust and an ode to the power of individual conscience and compassion in the face of unfathomable evil. Directed by Steven Spielberg, this film is a hauntingly poignant portrayal of one man's transformation from opportunist to savior amidst the atrocities of World War II.The story follows Oskar Schindler, a German businessman brilliantly portrayed by Liam Neeson, who initially seeks to profit from the war by employing Jewish labor in his factories. However, as he witnesses the systematic persecution and genocide of Jews under Nazi rule, Schindler undergoes a moral awakening. His efforts to save the lives of over a thousand Jewish workers, guided by his accountant Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley), become an act of defiance against the inhumanity of the Holocaust.Spielberg's direction captures the harrowing realities of the Holocaust with unflinching authenticity, employing black and white cinematography to evoke a haunting sense of history. The film's stark visuals, coupled with John Williams' haunting score, create an emotionally immersive experience that leaves an indelible impact on the audience.What sets ""Schindler's List"" apart is its unwavering portrayal of both the depths of human cruelty and the glimmer of hope found in acts of altruism. It's a narrative that confronts the darkest chapters of history while honoring the resilience and humanity of those who resisted.The performances, especially Neeson's portrayal of Schindler's gradual transformation from a profiteer to a savior, resonate with emotional depth. The supporting cast adds layers of authenticity to the characters, showcasing the resilience and tragedy of those caught in the Holocaust's grip.Beyond its cinematic achievements, ""Schindler's List"" serves as a powerful educational tool, a stark reminder of the consequences of hate and the importance of standing up against injustice. Its impact extends far beyond the screen, challenging viewers to confront the atrocities of the past and champion compassion and tolerance in the present.Decades after its release, the film remains a cinematic landmark-a testament to the filmmaker's dedication to preserving history and telling stories that transcend entertainment, leaving an enduring legacy as a powerful, emotionally raw portrayal of one of humanity's darkest chapters.",1 January 2024

This manages to be a very intimate personal film and yet also a film of great scale with huge sets and hundreds of extras. The acting is superb, very strong and it chillingly shows the casual cold ruthlessness of Nazi soldiers and spies. It also sets up this interesting and powerful tug of war and battle of wills between the two key characters. One is almost a kind of beast, a man who kills for pleasure, the other we are uncertain at first about, a war profiter and a rationalist or a humanitarian who is working subtly to undermine Nazi efforts. Ben Kingsley also deserves a lot of praise for his performance too. Some of the cinematography I really can't stress enough how good it is, a character who catches a glimpse of himself in the mirror and the powerful effect of that, it's just superb filmmaking.

",9,"Dangal, more than simply a Bollywood film is a masterpiece of cinema. Various interesting choices are made in the film, particularly the story being narrated by Mahavir's nephew Omkar (played by Ritvik Sahore and Aparshakti Khurana) which gives the viewer the impression that Mahavir (Aamir Khan) is the main character of the film - SPOILER ALERT: he's not -. Another interesting choice was the framing of the story itself. Mahavir didn't want his daughters to succeed as wrestlers because that was their passion, and as a father he wanted to push them to reach their full potential, not at all. What he really wanted was to live his dream through their children - this is not a hot take by any means. The character literally says it himself - which honestly makes him a jerk.Performance-wise Ritvik Sahore and Aparshakti Khurana were great as comedic relief characters. Fatima Sana Shaikh and Zaira Wasim - who played adult and child Geeta Phogat respectively - were also remarkable. But the most outstanding performance, hands down, was Aamir Khan's. It feels like he gives no less than 100% in every single scene. The score and original soundtrack are also beautifully done and capture the spirit of the film to perfection.In other words, Dangal is an immersive and enjoyable experience from beginning to end worth watching and rewatching.",21 December 2023

It also teaches lessons of greed and how money, despite causing many issues in life, (which is an undeniable fact), isn't something you can let take over your life.It is a great film and one that focuses on substance over style, something where a lot of films do the opposite. There are a few editing/audio scuffs here and there and the cinematography isn't the most ambitious which could be score-lowering factors, but I just think there is way too much substance and care put into this film for it to be any lower.

Neither the memories of the people whose memories are respected, nor the dead... Isn't it God who created them too? .. But there were those among them who had a conscience, like Oscar Schindler. The path he followed is still being debated by some groups. It is said, 'The man thought about his own labor force, capital and earnings', yes, the man thought about himself, but besides that, he saved as many people as he could and is indifferent to this inhumane treatment like the others. At least there are no more. What can I say? I wish there had never been wars, so many innocent and defenseless people had never died. If children had lived in a more colorful and innocent world.

Winning six Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Hanks, the 1994 film stands as a cultural touchstone for American cinema. It spans several decades, detailing the eponymous character's unintentional influence on important historical events.The earnest and innocent Forrest Gump, played by Tom Hanks, narrates his life story while awaiting a bus in Savannah, Georgia. His tale unfolds in flashbacks, revealing his accidental encounters with key moments of 20th century American history. From teaching Elvis Presley to dance to uncovering the Watergate scandal, Forrest's simple-minded but deeply humane perspective offers a fresh lens on familiar events. His loves, losses, and unwavering loyalty to those important to him, particularly his childhood love, Jenny, anchor the film's heartfelt narrative.Hanks' portrayal of Gump is nothing short of masterful; he imbues the character with a gentle, earnest naiveté that charms viewers and anchors the film's emotional core. Supporting performances, especially by Robin Wright as Jenny and Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan, skillfully complement Hanks, reflecting the film's spectrum of American experiences during decades of change. The visual effects are subtle yet impactful, flawlessly inserting Forrest into historic footage, while Alan Silvestri's score perfectly captures the film's shifting tones from whimsy to solemnity.A triumph in storytelling, Forrest Gump delights and moves its audience, often simultaneously. It is a film bursting with heart, humor, and an unwavering optimism embodied by its lead character. I rate this film 10/10 not only for its technical accomplishments but for its enduring ability to resonate with and inspire audiences. This cinematic journey is a must-see for anyone with an interest in a compassionate and whimsical take on American history.

There was a very natural flow to the story which helped engage the audience for 2 hours and 41 minutes.

I have said this that dialogue shouldn't seem like dialogue unless it is a musical or a re-imagining of a play. The dialogue in this movie is a lesson as to how dialogue should be used. Little nods and grunts and expressions serve more than an explanatory conversation. I am not a fan of narration and I wasn't really liking it here either. It was fine for the light-hearted scenes but the serious scenes required silence but I can give it a pass.

",9,"I have watched many good movies in my time. Oppenheimer is the cream of the crop. This movie is a biopic on J. Robert Oppenheimer. However, it is so much more than that. Within this 3 hour movie, there is so much going on and so much to be learnt. I have always believed that movies have a meaning and we can learn many things from them.To me Oppenheimer shows how someone who is so smart can be so naive. Many times in the movie Dr Oppenheimer is shown to be doing things which are clearly detrimental to his reputation. Yet he doesn't seem to understand that. For example, he was carrying out union meetings inside the university when the recruitment for the Manhattan project was taking place.Another thing which stood out for me in this movie is the saying ""what comes around goes around"". Strauss played a very dirty game against Dr Oppenheimer because he was humiliated by Dr Oppenheimer. Dr Oppenheimer lost his security clearance and credibility as a consequence of Strauss's actions. Strauss was refused by Senate as a Cabinet nominee because Dr Hill came forward to bring to light what Strauss had done to Dr Oppenheimer. Something to note is that the 2 times we saw Dr Hill and Dr Oppenheimer together, Dr Oppenheimer was seemingly mean to Dr Hill. Despite that Dr Hill still stood up and told the truth.Oppenheimer has done everything to perfection. The writing, directing, acting and the iconic music score. I have seen many of Christopher Nolan's work and I do believe this might just be his masterpiece.

",9,"With Oppenheimer, his first biopic, writer/director Christopher Nolan once again proves he's up to the challenge of balancing a difficult subject matter with a very tricky character piece. The slow, careful process of scientific discovery is rarely friendly to film, and shy, socially-awkward introverts do not often make for compelling leads, but in this case Nolan juggles both and steps away smelling like roses. As he'd already done on more than one occasion, in decidedly different flavors.Here we track the career of a famed theoretical physicist, thrust into the limelight as the so-called ""father of the atom bomb"" during the crush of World War 2 and then dismissed by an ungrateful government after he'd outlived his usefulness and started asking difficult follow-up questions. Oppenheimer's frustrated early career, meteoric rise to fame and equally rapid fall from grace are depicted almost simultaneously, in a rush of confused, overlapped memories. This style of all-at-once storytelling, in which foreshadowing coexists with its own outcome, is reminiscent of the time-blurred motifs we've already seen in Tenet, Inception and Dunkirk. Here it serves as a compelling way to digest a lot of information in a very short amount of time, especially when paired with a head-spinning series of metaphorical visual effects and an entrancing musical score. I've read the book this film was based upon, a daunting 800-page tome, and after the first hour I felt like I'd just read most of it all over again. This time with a little extra dramatic pizazz.It's an impressive display of top-notch filmmaking, proficiently depicting a historical scenario in which everyone already knows the ending and climaxing with a tense, powerful visualization of the Trinity tests which first loosed the power of violent nuclear fission upon the world. I loved every moment, but then, I was already deeply invested in the subject and had done some homework. My wife, far less prepared, was also far less enchanted. I think this may be more of a knock on Oppenheimer the man than Oppenheimer the film. A complicated, often misguided individual who, for all his brilliance within the hidden world of molecular physics, was inherently flawed and broken in a human sense. Nolan makes no apology for this, baring the person (and his many blemishes) to the screen with no filter, and the results aren't always pretty.Perhaps a bit too long, especially in the painfully bitter, sixty-minute postscript, but I'm not sure where I'd want to see a cut. Certainly not a feel-good audience pleaser, Nolan's latest is an exhausting experience, but also rich, thoughtful and rewarding.",4 January 2024

Relegating femels to support roles, as in the 1950s, is sophomoric in the 21st century. The title itself, Return of the King, is symbolic of the desire of many (past and present) to be kings of their own castles, with the little ladies as helpmates, as in this film. The Lord of the Rings trilogy ignores one vital fact as the society in which it was born. Solving problems and achieving goals is an all-hands on deck endeavor; both halves equally partnering. It was never a beneficial idea to have a society run by only half of us. Utilizing the brilliance and gifts of both halves of huminity makes better films and a better world.Partnering with the other half of the country, the film might have been shorter; the action might have been more imaginative instead of predictable; perhaps, we would have had less machismo; and the violence would not have been graphic at all.

If one really wanted to make the book you would have about two hours of poetry and a 56 hour movie. Movie-making is, unfortunately, forced to play by different rules. First of all, this film could not have been made until now. Imagine people dressed as trees. Remember those old Superman serials where whenever the Man of Steel flies, he becomes animated. Now that is genuinely bad. What Peter Jackson did here will be his legacy; had he died the day the film was complete, he would go down in film history. Everything is set up. The ring must be returned. Frodo is drunk with power and is latched on by the forces of evil. Those continuing the quest must face the ultimate and some do.

Everything about the organization of the Manhattan Project, the organization of Los Alamos, discussions about physics and bomb testing were very interesting to me, I loved those parts.I think putting the main character in an audience where he had to explain all his actions was a cheesy and lazy script device. Just as I found Lewis Strauss' idea of explaining everything he thought and planned to his own advisors to be very absurd. Shouldn't they already know all this?I also didn't understand why the Lewis Strauss scenes were in black and white. It didn't make much sense to me.I think the exaggerated soundtrack contributed to making the film more interesting, otherwise the story could have been quite boring.The performances from everyone involved were very good but especially from Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon and Robert Downey Jr., I also liked Kenneth Branagh as Niels Bohr.I understood the idea of the film: he made the bomb but felt guilty about the deaths and spent the next few years trying to stop the hydrogen bomb from being made. Interesting, I just think it was told in a rather boring way.In the end, a very good film. It would have been a fantastic film if it had focused less on the post-war period and more on Oppenheimer's life before the war.

The second hour is extremely morally challenging as characters question whether or not they should use the bomb. The Trinity Test was incredibly shot and editing, the practical effects are stunning yet terrifying. The third and last hour is probably my favorite part of the film, as it deals with guilt and punishment. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr.'s performances stand out like a sore thumb.

Robert Oppenheimer but also delves into the complex moral and ethical implications of scientific advancements. Directed by visionary filmmaker chris nolan, this biographical drama is a mesmerizing journey through the mind of a man whose contributions to science changed the course of history.The film opens with a captivating portrayal of Oppenheimer's early years, providing a nuanced understanding of his intellect, struggles, and personal conflicts. Actor cillian murphy delivers an exceptional performance, seamlessly embodying the complexity of Oppenheimer's character, from his academic pursuits to the moral dilemmas he faced during the development of the atomic bomb.The cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking, capturing the essence of each era in Oppenheimer's life with meticulous attention to detail. The juxtaposition of intense scientific discussions with personal moments creates a compelling narrative that keeps the audience engaged from start to finish.What sets ""Openheimer"" apart is its unflinching exploration of the ethical implications of scientific progress. The film doesn't shy away from addressing the moral ambiguity surrounding Oppenheimer's role in the Manhattan Project and the devastating consequences of the atomic bombings. It invites viewers to reflect on the dual nature of scientific advancements - their potential for both good and harm.The musical score, composed by ludwig goransson complements the film beautifully, enhancing the emotional impact of key scenes. The use of period-appropriate music further immerses the audience in the historical setting, creating a sensory experience that resonates long after the credits roll.The supporting cast, including robert downey junior delivers standout performances, contributing to the overall authenticity of the narrative. The chemistry between characters adds depth to the storytelling, making the interpersonal dynamics as compelling as the scientific discussions.""Openheimer"" is not just a biopic; it's a thought-provoking exploration of the human condition. It challenges viewers to grapple with the consequences of scientific discovery and the responsibilities that come with knowledge. In an era where ethical considerations in science are more relevant than ever, this film serves as a poignant reminder of the power that rests in the hands of those who push the boundaries of human understanding.In conclusion, ""Openheimer"" is a cinematic masterpiece that seamlessly weaves together historical accuracy, powerful performances, and a profound exploration of morality.

It truly is remarkable how much work went into this, but also unfortunate that it landed the animators in such a difficult work environment. While all of the voice acting is phenomenal, my biggest issue comes in with the characters. First, taking a joke villain like the Spot and turning him into a truly creepy and powerful foe is no small feat and I commend the writers for pulling that off. The issue comes with Spider-Man, all of them. Besides Miles Morales, every version of Spider-Man is perverse with the out of line ideals of the Spider Society. There are no versions of Spider-Man that would ever stand by those ideals and it is wild how every current mainstream Spidey has lost the meaning of what the character stands for.

So we end up having zero complaints eating subpar dialogues, classic cheap tricks like driving tension by artificially induced miscommunication, or single-agenda characters that follow their prescribed paths without deviation natural to real human beings.I can't deny that it felt good watching this film. But I am left with a tingling concern that it wasn't due to the complexity of emotions or a wide gamut of thoughts that it made us experience, but simply because our brains produced lots of happy chemicals in response to this sensory DDoS attack. Which, technically, is an achievement akin to the discovery of LSD, profound in its influence on the world. But, as with any real world drug, it makes you wonder: can feelings alone be trusted when evaluating the whole experience?Modern problems require modern solutions.

",10,"Just experienced the emotional rollercoaster that is ""Life is Beautiful,"" and I'm still grappling with the impact of this extraordinary film. Directed by and starring Roberto Benigni, this Italian tragicomedy takes you on a journey through the darkest depths of human history while somehow managing to find beauty and humor in the most unlikely places.Let's start with Benigni's performance. The man is a revelation. His portrayal of Guido, a Jewish man imprisoned in a concentration camp, is a delicate balance of heart-wrenching emotion and comedic brilliance. Benigni's charisma is infectious, and his ability to inject humor into the grimmest of situations is nothing short of genius. No wonder he walked away with the Academy Award for Best Actor; it's a performance that stays with you long after the credits roll.""Life is Beautiful"" is a masterclass in blending genres. It seamlessly transitions from a charming romantic comedy set in pre-World War II Italy to a harrowing depiction of life inside a concentration camp. The contrast is stark, but the film handles it with grace, making the emotional impact even more profound. It's a testament to Benigni's storytelling prowess that he can make you laugh and cry in the same breath.The narrative structure is another standout element. The first half of the film introduces us to Guido's whimsical world, filled with love, laughter, and an unwavering optimism. As the story takes a dark turn with the characters' internment in a concentration camp, that optimism becomes a beacon of hope in the bleakest of circumstances. The way Benigni intertwines the two halves is nothing short of cinematic brilliance.The relationship between Guido and his son, Giosuè, is the emotional core of the film. Guido's relentless determination to shield his son from the horrors of their reality by turning their situation into a game is both heartwarming and heart-wrenching. The innocence of Giosuè and his belief in the game adds a layer of poignancy that tugs at your heartstrings.Visually, the film is a treat. The vibrant colors of the pre-war scenes sharply contrast with the muted tones of the concentration camp, emphasizing the stark shift in the characters' lives. The cinematography captures the beauty in the ordinary and the brutality of the extraordinary with equal finesse.""Life is Beautiful"" is a profound exploration of the resilience of the human spirit. It doesn't shy away from the atrocities of history, yet it manages to find moments of joy and love that transcend the darkness. The film's title is both a mantra for Guido and a poignant message that lingers with the audience, prompting reflection on the preciousness of life even in the face of unspeakable horrors.In conclusion, ""Life is Beautiful"" is a cinematic masterpiece that defies easy categorization. It's a testament to the power of storytelling to illuminate the human experience in all its complexity. Roberto Benigni's vision, coupled with his stellar performance, creates a film that is equal parts heartrending and uplifting, leaving an indelible mark on anyone fortunate enough to experience its magic.",17 December 2023

",9,"As a fellow director, I approach Inception with both admiration and a touch of envy. Christopher Nolan has crafted a film that is as audacious in its concept as it is meticulous in its execution. He takes the ever-fascinating landscape of dreams and constructs a heist unlike any other, plunging us into a world where the stakes are not jewels or gold, but the very fabric of reality.Narrative Labyrinth: The script is a masterpiece of intricacy. Nolan masterfully juggles multiple layers of dreams within dreams, constantly testing the audience's grasp on reality. He utilizes exposition cleverly, weaving it into the action without sacrificing narrative momentum. While some may find the plot convoluted, the reward for deciphering its layers is immense.Visual Spectacle: Inception is a feast for the eyes. Nolan, in collaboration with cinematographer Wally Pfister, pushes the boundaries of visual storytelling. From the gravity-defying hotel hallway to the collapsing cityscapes, the film is a symphony of stunning visuals that leave audiences breathless. The special effects, seamlessly integrated into the film, enhance the dreamlike quality without ever becoming a distraction.Emotional Core: Beneath the mind-bending layers, Inception is a deeply personal story. Dom Cobb, our protagonist, is haunted by guilt and loss. His yearning for closure drives him to accept the seemingly impossible mission. The film explores themes of memory, regret, and the power of the subconscious, adding an emotional depth that resonates long after the credits roll.",28 December 2023

There are certainly some good moments and elements, like the race was genuinely intense, the child actors worked well, but apart from this movie being endearing, I have no idea how it could be so praised. The entire story has so many dumb and convenient moments. The family dynamic is underdeveloped, and so are all the characters. These kids seem like they're not able to communicate well, like why doesn't Ali explain the reason he's late? Im pretty sure the teachers would understand. I mean it may not work, but it could, which is the point, show it, otherwise Ali who gets good grades just seems dumb. When he cries to be in the race it definitely sends the wrong message for this kids movie. Simple words could solve so many of their issues, but they just sit there and make up extremely basic lies that nobody will believe or cry. Wow great characters! What about Ali's sister explaining the the girl that those might be her shoes? Then she might've gotten them back. I thought perhaps this was going to reflect on how the parents raised them, like the father wasn't able to communicate well either when he's to garden for the wealthy people, but nope, suddenly Ali comes to the rescue and does all the talking for him. I'm being a bit lenient considering they're children, but this just seemed like sloppy writing to me, especially considering how the storyline is haphazardly set up, going from inconvenience, to convenience, inconvenience, convenience, and so on. It's the simplest way to manipulate- I mean garner sympathy from the audience. It's also doesn't help that like the story being so choppy, it's not very well paced or edited either. Scenes just jump around, and it has one of the most sudden endings. I mean I guess it concluded, but there could've been a bit more of an aftermath. What happened to Ali playing football in the final game with his friend? This is just not a very good movie in any way, and I can't understand how anyone is praising this unless you're swept by the movie's emotions. If so then I guess it'll work for you, and it did have some pretty good emotional moments for me too but it's pretty easy to sympathize with children.

",10,"""Inception,"" directed by the visionary Christopher Nolan, is an extraordinary cinematic achievement that redefines the boundaries of storytelling. This film is not just a movie; it's an intricate labyrinth of ideas, emotions, and breathtaking visuals that pulls you into its depths from the first frame to the last.Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a powerful performance as Dom Cobb, a skilled thief who infiltrates the subconscious of his targets. DiCaprio masterfully portrays Cobb's internal battle, balancing his professional prowess with his haunted past. The supporting cast, including Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, and Marion Cotillard, are equally compelling, each adding depth and intrigue to the narrative.The concept of the film is its most striking aspect. Nolan introduces the idea of dream extraction and inception with such finesse that it seems both fantastical and plausible. The story unfolds like a Russian nesting doll, with layers within layers, each more intricate than the last. This complexity is not just for show; it forms the backbone of the film's exploration of themes like perception, reality, and personal catharsis.The visual effects in ""Inception"" are nothing short of groundbreaking. From the Paris dreamscape bending in on itself to the zero-gravity hallway fight, each scene is a marvel of cinematic artistry. The special effects serve the story, enhancing the surreal quality of the dream world while maintaining a sense of visceral reality.Hans Zimmer's score is another element that elevates ""Inception."" The music is both haunting and beautiful, perfectly complementing the film's tone and enhancing the emotional impact of key scenes. The use of the slowed-down version of Edith Piaf's ""Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien"" is particularly ingenious, intertwining with the plot in a way that is both clever and impactful.What truly sets ""Inception"" apart is its ability to challenge the viewer intellectually while providing a thrilling, emotionally resonant story. It's a film that invites analysis and discussion, offering new insights with each viewing. The ending, which has sparked much debate, is a stroke of genius, leaving the audience questioning the nature of reality and the power of the human mind.In conclusion, ""Inception"" is more than just a movie; it's an experience that pushes the boundaries of what cinema can achieve. It's a rare gem that combines intellectual depth with sheer entertainment value. For its innovative storytelling, stunning visuals, exceptional performances, and profound thematic exploration, ""Inception"" deserves nothing less than a perfect 10 out of 10.",21 December 2023

But then it starts working about an hour/70 minutes in and the performance from Vicky Kaushal as Udham Singh starts to deepen in how he's underplaying his role (in the first half) and making us lean in to see what is going on with this man's undying conviction that this man in his sights to assassinate is total scum (and we get some good scenes showing us what a Royal Imperial horror he is as well).The direction is not flashy, at least in the London scenes, and it works to the benefit of the drama overall; this is far from what you might see in a more typical Aamir Khan heightened/weepy Melodrama, rather it's closer to something like a prestige biopic from one of the art-house/independent labels from Hollywood (not a negative if not a major boost either).And where it leads to in the third act - if this even has acts - is devastating, in bringing to a head what Singh was going through all those years; this is a long sequence that takes up so much time and so much wasted life, but it is necessary to understanding what scars it left on this man's soul (the pushing of the cart alone, my goodness). It's a captivating film because it doesn't tell us how to feel about what this man was doing all that time and what we see him do early on in the story, rather it just shows it and trusts we can make up our minds - and his story is by extension the story of generations of British-Indian oppression and colonial brutality (I know that term is redundant but you get what I mean).If it gets into repetition (needlessly) it's in the many torture scenes, or in feeling to have to show the assassination a second time, and the CGI blood in the massacre in the last part takes one out of it; it still doesn't stop much of the film from being watchable well hewed drama.",8 September 2023

The way the narrative is executed, the comedy is inserted and even how the visuals are displayed is, without a shadow of a doubt, dated. Does this mean that the work is bad seen through today's eyes? No. The work well portrays its time and the vision of the future that society had. Everything here is a huge reflection of the 80s. Even so, the work doesn't become any less thought-provoking and fun. Every film will always be dated when seen decades later, but that doesn't make it bad.The film, from the beginning, tells the viewer, in an indirect way, what will happen at the end of this story. This is one of the strong points of this film. Back to the Future thinks about many details to make the story round, even if the script falls into problems presented in works that explore time travel. The most important detail of the narrative is exactly how everything is extremely connected. All the scenes presented during the film are important for the development of the narrative and show importance again throughout it. Small details shown in small scenes always return to close the story in a satisfactory way and still leave a hook for a continuation.During many moments the small details presented are not said by the characters, but shown by small images in the foreground. The film takes advantage of small occasions to develop the narrative for the viewer, even though these details often don't seem important at first. Some scenes perfectly demonstrate the differences between the past and future using only the scenery and signs.Back to the Future is a brilliant work that marked its time and is still remembered today as a great classic.

The film was superbly directed and has energy , life and colour in each and every scene. The 1950s that Marty returns to is a bright and colourful environment. The use of colour is well thought through Marty wears bright colours, blue jeans, an orange jacket to reflect his happy easy going personality. Generally bad things tend to happen at night such as Loraine being attacked or Doc being shot.All the characters are really over the top and it works, we have the High School Bully, the mad scientist, the girl next door type, the nerdy wimp, the stern teacher. I actually found Biff a little disturbing, he actually seems quite dangerous to both the boys and girls he picks on, in several scenes characters he goes after barely get away.The first 10 minutes suggest the opening of a high-school themed movie about a boy who wants to play guitar and his dysfunctional family, it quickly switches to more of a Sci-fi element , then into action, and then to comedy and then into the realms of romance. It's these swings and changes which constantly keep you on your toes and enjoying the film, each new part brings fresh energy and pace to the story.The film is just incredibly funny and sweet and clever.

Fox), a teenager who accidentally travels back in time to 1955 in a DeLorean car modified by his eccentric scientist friend Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). There, he meets his young parents and inadvertently interferes with their budding romance, putting his own existence at risk. He must find a way to make them fall in love again and return to the future, while avoiding the dangers of the past and the paradoxes of time travel.The film is a masterpiece of storytelling, with a tight script, a fast pace, and a perfect balance of comedy and drama. The film is full of witty dialogue, hilarious situations, and memorable characters, such as the villainous Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), the charming Lorraine Baines (Lea Thompson), and the nerdy George McFly (Crispin Glover). The film also explores themes such as fate, free will, identity, family, and friendship, and offers a nostalgic and humorous look at the 1950s and the 1980s.The film is also a technical marvel, with impressive special effects, a catchy soundtrack, and a brilliant performance by Fox, who plays both the young and the old Marty with charisma and energy. Lloyd is also outstanding as the eccentric and lovable Doc Brown, who delivers some of the most iconic lines of the film, such as ""Great Scott!"" and ""Where we're going, we don't need roads"". The chemistry between Fox and Lloyd is palpable and makes their friendship one of the most endearing aspects of the film.Back to the Future is a film that has aged well and still entertains and delights audiences of all ages and backgrounds.

",8,"Fincher's mastery of mise en scene is probably never better than here in Se7en. Like Virgil, Fincher guides us through Hell, but Hell on Earth, designed around a serial killer using the Biblical seven deadly sins as his motive. The scenes of death (always post crime) are meticulously filmed and edited to ensure we are never mere observers but at one with the ongoing investigation and as we spiral down deeper into the abyss the world around us becomes more terrifying, none more so than that of the prostitute killing. Interspersed is a brilliant chase scene during a rainstorm where even the weather seems to be weaponised.Morgan Freeman is simply peerless and doesn't put a foot wrong. Brad Pitt, for me, struggles with his delivery at times, almost overacting to try and make the point but his physicality and screen presence is comparable with Steve McQueen at his finest and brilliantly handles his wordless part in the demoument, the despair of wanting revenge and trying to resist, riddled in his eyes.Spacey appears only briefly, but his character, like Harry Lime in The Third Man, kept in the background, haunts subsequent viewings.My one problem is with the demouement and I'm sure it will be contentious with Se7en fans.The power of what John Doe does is his belief that he is wreaking vengeance on those that deserve it - cue his valedictory in the car en route to the final scene, where he espouses the righteousness of his actions. How, one might ask, does his final killing of Tracy fit that scenario? She is simply a pregnant wife scared for the future of her baby being born into such a cruel world. John Doe, knowing this, despatches an innocent victim in a despicable manner and contrary to the design of his previous murders. We discover that this is designed to provoke Mills, who has shown his penchant for losing his temper, to despatch John Doe and complete the deadly sin cycle of Covetousness (John Doe) and Wrath (Mills) but in doing so this consigns John Doe's actions to that of yet another serial killer and diminishes the power of the original premise.I believe the script acknowledges the problematic, introducing the dialogue from John Doe's telephone converstion with Mills after his apartment is discovered, where John Doe informs the detectives he will have to alter his plans, insinuating that there were different envy/wrath punishments in the offing. What these were we are never told but we presume the ultimate outcome of these would still have been the self-sacrifice of John Doe at the end and with the best will in the world I can't see how he would've achieved that.It's a small criticism of a film that, more than many at the end of the nineties, encapsultes the violence of the 20th century and prophesizes the fears of the 21st.",2 January 2024

The acting is also superb, Morgan Freeman gives another brilliant performance as the disillusioned detective and Brad Pitt is great as Mills in a more meatier role than he has ever done.

Despite being very revolutionary, well written well acted, it is just an all around catchy, fun and riveting experience overall.The actors all do an incredible job, very career defining, some of the, if not the best, of each ones' careers, for sure - and the script accompining it is a great blend of humour and some drama, chronicling and celebrating cinema and showbiz in stellar ways.The cinematography, cutting and editing is incredible, its affect on cinema and how revolutionary it is can never be overstated. It is so beautifully put together, extremely and thouroughly well done.Overall, indeed one of the all time great classics for the ages.

The premise is fun... a silent film duo look to make the jump to ""talkies"" except one has a terrible voice and no real performance skills. Enter the talented (but unknown) chorus girl to dub her voice and help save the day.Yes, it's a bit dopey and farcical at times, but who cares? Kelly, O'Connor, Reynolds, and Hagen all shine in their roles, with almost effortless ease and sincerity. And yes, the story seems to wander on occasion just to accommodate a couple of song and dance numbers that don't factor at all in the plot, but the songs and dance ARE the stars of the film, so this is excusable. In the end, we're left with a cute Hollywood love story, and a ""triumph of good"" tale, wrapped up in a magical package of dance and glitz, and that's plenty. An 8.5 bumped up to a 9 because the dancing is great, and Kelly's ""Singin in the Rain"" sequence is iconic.",18 December 2023

",7,"BMB is a biographical film based upon the life story Indian athlete Milkha Singh. His childhood life, his proffessional life, personal stories, his career as an Indian representative in Athletes cover the entire film. The movie is well scripted but is heavily draggy, to imply the emotions of the story. Another issue is the BGM ie rock score ; it didn't felt like well relatable to a person from 1930s. The characters are not bright ; rather dull and doesn't felt like that of defense guys. Not even Prakash Raj and Farhan Akhtar didn't get lighten up to their potential. Its just raw depiction, nothing higher than that. The depiction of emotions especially the partition issues fails to take a grip. Other actress and performances are good to watch.The impressive thing shown in the film is that of Milkha Singh character, his dedication to his goal among so many Distractions. His self understanding of his own erroneous actions are praiseworthy points that makes the protagony as the bright point. But as usual ROM seem to be confused about what the direction of the narrtives should be. It felt less like a biography and gets inlined towards sports theme. But then biographical approach again takes a hold on and goes like that successively. Summing up its not a masterpiece but a good movie in biographical attempt. Just one or two watch. For the attempt it is a 65/100.",24 October 2022

To continue, temperamental Lina must have a terrible voice dubbed by aspiring actress Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds). Then the silent film star Kelly falls for a chorus girl just as he and his delusionally jealous screen partner are trying to make the difficult transition to talking pictures in 1920s Hollywood. Singin' Swingin' Glorious Feelin' Technicolor Musical. MGM's Technicolr Musical Treasure!. What a Glorious Feeling !. MGM's Musical Treasure !A classic musical film written by experts Adolph Green , Betty Comden - later a Broadway musical- with top-drawer stars, entertainment, spectacular numbers, hilarious set pieces, big fun, and of course there's classic Kelly's much-copied title dance, in which he shoots his greatest number with a heavy cold. One of all-time great movie musicals and an affectionate spoof of the turmoil that afflicted the motion picture industry in the later 1920s during the changeover from silent films to sounds. This enchanting, lavish musical stars Gene Kelly who discovers a deep love while dancing magnificently through wonderful scenarios, , though filming mostly in in the MGM studios with no outdoors ; in fact , while it sure looks like Hollywood's Los Angeles, most of it was shot in studios. One of Gene Kelly's classic musicals , in all , the movie offers appointingly several pleasures, a big and unforgettable show. The movie is a heady mixture of Hollywood comedy, breathtaking dances and slight entertainment. Main highlight is the sweeping musical score and Gene Kelly's knock-out choreography. Standing out the astonishing 15-minute final ballet which holds the record for one of the longest movie dance number and one of the most expensive, pegged at over half a million for a month of shooting. Audiences for big screen musicals were waning when the famous production company Metro Goldwyn Mayer put this stage hit before the cameras and getting success enough. Stars two splendid actors and dancers : Gene Kelly in yet another of his more whimsical characters and Donald O'Connor's an acrobatic marvel as Don's best pal, as well as Debbie Reynolds as a beautiful dancer who possesses an enjoyable voice. They are well accompanied by a nice cast , such as : Jean Hagen as the famous silent actress Lina who has an excruciatingly shrill voice , Millard Mitchell, Cyd Charisse, Douglas Fowley, Rita Moreno, among others .It displays a colorful and glamorous cinematography in picturesque style -Technicolor and Cinemascope- by Harold Rosson. Marvellous scenarios, worth artificial-looking production design that only emphasised its stagebound origins. Lavishly produced by Arthur Freed, the motion picture was compellingly directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, it is a loving-care job. The great filmmaker Stanley Donen realized several musical masterpieces , many of them with the help of producer Arthur Freed. As he directed some of the best musicals of history such as ¨On the town¨, ¨Singing in the rain¨, ¨Royal Wedding¨ , ¨It's always fair weather¨, ¨Seven brides for seven brothers ¨, ¨Funny face¨ and with Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe he made ¨The Little Prince¨, among others .

",10,"Singin In the Rain is arguably the best movie musical of all time, not just because of the music but because of the entire package - the premise, the comedy, the characters - everything here works together to make you feel better any time you sit down to watch it. It's ironic that this movie was thrown together quickly to capitalize on the success of ""An American in Paris"", since the improvisational feeling of the movie is one of the things that makes it so much fun. Although this film is number ten on the top 100 films of all time as compiled by the American Film Institute, it wasn't nominated for best picture the year of its release, 1952. Although it did well at the box office, it would be over twenty years before people would look back and realize just what a great motion picture it was. Perhaps that was because the 1970's were such bleak and cynical years, with movies that largely matched that mood, that people were eager to rediscover the fun that a motion picture viewing experience could be.The movie focuses on that period of time in which the entire motion picture film industry was in nervous transition from silent to talking pictures. Although the movie compresses time in this respect - the transition actually took about three years - it does accurately describe the technical problems of that era along with their comical aspects. There was an overabundance of musicals in the first batch of talking films, many stars did have heavy accents that made their speech undecipherable or voices that came across like nails on a chalkboard like Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) and saw their careers ruined, and early sound technology itself was so fragile that you would often see actors speaking to potted plants or to coat racks with comic effect. The preview of silent picture team Lockwood and Lamont's first talkie, ""The Dueling Cavalier"", is one of the most hilarious scenes in the film. It is pretty typical of what you would see in such an early talking picture - dialogue going in and out of sync, actors and actresses strutting around and wildly gesturing as if nobody can hear them, and dialogue that still resembled what you would read off of the title cards in a silent film - ""I love you, I love you, I love you"".All of this is one of the reasons Singin' In The Rain will never get dated - it is a comic nostalgic look at a very narrow period in time. This movie is fun outside of its comic take on movie history, though. For one, it's hard to say who steals the show the most, since there are so many thieves involved. Most notably there is Jean Hagen - who actually has a very pleasant speaking voice - as the evil silent star who can't accept her days are numbered. Then there is a 27 year-old Donald O'Connor as Cosmo, the studio music director and sidekick of Gene Kelly's character whose youthful exuberance really shines in the number ""Make 'Em Laugh"" along with all of his goofy facial expressions. He seems to be having as much fun as the audience. Finally, there are all of the great dance numbers and music, capped by probably one of the most famous scenes of all time - Gene Kelly's rendition of the title number that perfectly captures the joy of a man who has just fallen in love and feels he has the world at his feet. You just can't watch this film and not come away with a smile on your face. It is as good for the soul as chicken soup, just a lot more fun.23 out of 24 found this helpful.",6 November 2023

",10,"(1952) Singin' In the Rain
MUSICALI have to say that in terms of musicals so far this is the last of the greatest musicals of all time. And I refuse to compare this film to anything Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers had ever done together because they consist of two different styles of tap dancing to it's own degree. Much of 'Singin' In The Rain' is very direct and in- your face as opposed to Fred and Gingers dance routines are somewhat graceful, useful, perhaps convenient to ""Ballroom Dancing"" competitions. And what tap dancing ""Singin' in the Rain"" is, especially Donald O'Conner who stole a few scenes from Gene Kelly. But the best highlights are the tap dancing routines that are almost identically matched and exactly alike and slightly off between Gene Kelly and Donald O'Conner (Talking about perfect timing). Some seem almost impossible to do because the tap dancing involves tables and chairs, one would seem to wonder whether any of the characters had ever twisted there ankles, perhaps pull a ligament. This is what extreme tap dancing looks like and it is very fierce, much to the extent to wanting to witness those dancing moves again and again in repeated viewings. The catchy singing numbers is also one of the highlights as well because it is extremely hard to do this while dancing at the same time (rehearsed or otherwise) and doing this while smiling, everything seem to work in this film's favor. It'd even be more harder if all of this was done on an actual stage on front of thousands of people, which would result to a lot of aching bones which would consist of a lot of time for the process for healing. Some of the notable singing numbers include ""Make 'em laugh"" sung by Donald O'Conner, ""Good Morning"" sung by Gene, Donald and Debbie Reynolds and of course ""Singin in the rain"" by Gene Kelly!! This is the quintessential tap dancing film, which is not saying much.",1 November 2023

Mehra infuses realism into drama, and explores characters so deeply and sensitively through tragedy and triumph, that it sparks an emotional deluge.CAST & CREWRakeysh Omprakash MehraDirectorFarhan AkhtarActorRebecca BreedsActorYograj SinghActorPavan MalhotraActorPrakash RajActorDivya DuttaActorSonam KapoorActorJaptej SinghActorArt MalikActorSanjay GurbaxaniActorStory: A film inspired by the legendary Indian athlete, Milkha Singh's life and journey.Review: He doesn't sing for his supper. He runs. Every sinew tugging and rippling to be fed. For that one glass of milk(ha!). He had a choice to run away, or to run. He did the right thing, he ran. Oh yes, the eternal metaphor 'the race of life'. We're all runners. With reason enough? A finish line to shred? Milkha Singh did. He ran his first race for ek glass doodh. And he never stopped. Untiringly. He ran because it was his religion.'BMB' traces his scarred childhood, brutalized by India's Partition; followed by penury and petty crimes. He finds purpose in life when romance blooms with Beero (Sonam). Joining the Indian Army, where his mentor (Malhotra) inspires him to take the big 'leap'. Thereon, Milkha just runs. Barefooted, bruised, and with the weight of a suffering soul. He goes on to break records, but faces heartbreaking defeat at the Rome Olympics(1960). He takes it in his stride, overcomes his catastrophic past and ultimately emerges a winner.Mehra is brilliant at his craft; he infuses realism into drama, and explores characters so deeply and sensitively through tragedy and triumph, that it sparks an emotional deluge. The movie transitions from flashback sepia tones to moods of present, without losing the grip of emotions, ever.Cinematography is ace (Binod Pradhan); the music (Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy) heightens the drama. Prasoon's writing is powerful, lyrics are pure poetry and emotions robustly sweep the scenes with few dialogues. While there's a lot to marvel at, a hint of the director's over-indulgence in the art, results in a long 'runtime' and prolonged scenes that distract.Farhan is fantastic! He peeps through Milkha's core to essay this role. With an awe-inspiring body, grit and guts, he puts blood and sweat into Milkha. He races like an athlete, breaks into bhangra like a proud sardar and shows prowess of a Punjab-da-sher. In a brief role, Sonam prettily breezes through. Pavan and Divya (Singh's sister) are outstanding. Overall, 'BMB' pulsates with the storyteller's sheer passion all the way to the finish line.",10 July 2021

This David Fincher masterpiece stands tall as a benchmark in the thriller genre, weaving a tapestry of dread, suspense, and moral ambiguity that remains unmatched.From the stark, rain-soaked streets to the impeccable casting, every element of Se7en is meticulously crafted to immerse you in its grim and foreboding world. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt deliver powerhouse performances, their chemistry and contrasting approaches to the investigation adding layers of depth to their characters.The film's gritty and atmospheric cinematography, coupled with Howard Shore's haunting score, create an oppressive and chilling ambiance that seeps into your bones. But what truly elevates Se7en is its unflinching exploration of the darkest aspects of humanity. The meticulously planned murders, each representing a deadly sin, serve as a harrowing reflection of society's moral decay.Fincher's direction is nothing short of brilliant, masterfully building tension and delivering a gut-wrenching climax that leaves an indelible mark on the viewer. The narrative's relentless descent into despair is both horrifying and mesmerizing, showcasing a rare blend of storytelling prowess and visual artistry.Se7en isn't just a film; it's a visceral experience that stays etched in your mind long after the credits roll. It's a testament to the power of cinema to provoke, unsettle, and challenge our perceptions of good and evil.

The mystery of the killer is captivating, unexpected, and gruesome enough. The acting, cinematography, and dialogue are all well done. And there's some interesting philosophical moments about living amid the shortcomings of other humans.Unfortunately, the movie completely flops and doesn't stick the landing. The writing becomes completely contrived in the final scenes, abandoning both plot logic and the motivations of a couple of characters (John Doe and Somerset) in order to hamfistedly achieve the ending they wanted from it. I'm all for dark endings where the protagonists lose, however it has to be earned. It's not enough just to do something different, you have to do it well with a story that is still solid, and by the end this one just falls apart.",25 December 2023
rw9507249,ur14262019,tt0114369," Almost a masterpiece
",8,"I just rewatched Seven for the first time in probably about ten years. Everything's been said by now, but I had to lower the score from a 9 to an 8 for two reasons. One, although I usually like Pitt in his roles, the younger version of him here- he's not really a good actor yet, except for the final ten minutes. He was bumbling, unrealistically cocky at times, and it was hard to decipher some of his words. Juxtaposed to the outstanding acting of Freeman, it quite a bit feels like he drags some scenes down, at least until the end. Second, while I really enjoy how the script and movie overall deals with literature, sins, and philosophy, it doesn't quite dig deep enough to make a lasting mark on th viewer's insight; much like their library research, it feels more like a 101 class or cliffnotes. Now, at least they do scratch the surface, and there are two to three great conversations that go under the surface a little more, but despite these scenes the overall ending of the film makes it just equate to pessimism, which is not entirely true to life. While you empathize with Somerset's perspective, the fact is the vast majority of people are mostly good.In Conclusion, Seven deserves lots of credit for its originality (at the time), uniqueness, cinematography, more profound material for the typical entry into the genre in terms of philosophical debate and historical literature, as well as an awesome performance by Freeman, but ultimately it just misses becoming a true masterpiece for the same reason it became so popular: metaphorically hitting the audience with an emotional sledgehammer (as Spacey's character philosophizes) with an abrupt, pessimistic ending (good final scene quoting Hemingway, by the way) without quite delving deep enough into the surface-scratching literature leaves the viewer without much takeaway despite it, other than the fact it was a good, entertaining thriller movie. This disqualifies it from being a masterpiece and its current #19 ranking on here is surprising. It feels more like a #50-80 area range film, not a top 20 all-time, but still a classic.",21 December 2023

Interaction with the scenery, of course, is part of all musicals, but here it comes in a way that serves as an example for all other subsequent musicals in the history of cinema, especially when COSMO BROWN (Donald Connor), DON's inseparable friend, steals the show and the leading role in a song, solo, in an uncut musical sequence in several scenarios worthy of an Oscar for the main actor, even though he was acting in a supporting role.Well-fitted itinerary,

""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""Chariots of Fire,"" ""Amadeus,"" ""Shakespeare in Love,"" and, of course, ""Braveheart.""Most of them touch real history at points, though history is always more nuanced than streamlined stories invented by Hollywood, which is the home if money-grubbing big business which occasionally turns out a masterpiece that seems to undermine the values it dotes on.""Braveheart"" is a good movie as, like the others I named, it doesn't feel like it's real length. It moves at a cracking pace.The movie is full of solid performances from Gibson, Sophie Marceau, Patrick McGoohan and others.Some of these historical movies are more historical than others. ""Amadeus"" and ""Shakespeare in Love"" are truly great movies that look beautiful and have great performances but are barely on nodding acquaintences with history. ""Amadeus,"" like ""Lawrence"" and ""Chariots,"" is one of my favorites and I watch it a lot more often.""Braveheart"" is right in there slugging with the best of them.So why do I hate it? Not because the history is nonsense. No historical movie is less historical than ""Shakespeare in Love."" Sure, there's no bridge at the battle of Sterling Bridge and the Scots are fighting in kilts (kilts!) rather than armor, ya-da ya-da, but I'm not offended by the line in SIL where the guy playing the nurse in ""Romeo and Juliet"" tells a woman he's chatting up, ""It's about this nurse . . ."" I'm not offended by Peter O'Toole having half a foot or more on the real T. E. Lawrence; or the mis-identification of Harold Abrahams' G&S singing girlfriend; or the fact that Saliere didn't kill Mozart and was 100 miles away when Mozart died.Perhaps it's a long-time personal antipathy I have toward Gibson. I admire his courage in presenting ""The Passion of the Christ"" (a much better historical movie, albeit not in English). But I simply don't see his charm, from the time my brother and I watched the first ""Mad Max"" flick on TV.I remember an evening a good friend of mine suggested we have a double feature where we each had to watch the others' choices. It was a Mel Gibson evening. She selected ""What Women Want"" and I got ""Chicken Run."" We hated each other's movies. But I didn't mind Gibson in my choice when I couldn't see the guy.Anyway, take all the good things I said about this movie. As a fictional story (like ""Amadeus"") it's acceptable. But though I love tales of people fighting for freedom (which is why I love American history, an ongoing fight for freedom since 1776) I haven't watched this once since I saw it in the theatre nearly 30 years ago. I've been tempted, since I love McGoohan's acting and Sophie was never more beautiful; but I've resisted the temptation.At least, for its length, like the other movies I mentioned, it's never dull. It leaves me cold but that's a subjective thing. If you're indifferent toward Gibson, you might want to watch ""Chicken Run"" instead.",31 December 2023

Did Randall Wallace, the screenwriter, and Gibson know that the Battle of Stirling Bridge involved a bridge? You betcha. Did it matter to this mythmaking adventure? Nope, so they dropped it. What about the whole thing about the Princess of Wales actually just being a child in France at the time? Well, you don't get the grand romance of the second half without her, so in she goes, all adult and pretty. It's largely ahistorical nonsense in the details (getting the 30,000 foot few of the events largely correct), but the entertainment is the point. And the entertainment is good.The story of the First Scottish War for Independence begins with Edward Longshanks (Patrick McGoohan) and his brutal efforts to tamp down on Scottish sentiment against English rule by killing the men willing to fight, including the father of William Wallace (Gibson) who goes off to learn the world with his uncle Argyle (Brian Cox), returning as a young adult (Gibson doesn't look much like a young adult, to be honest) to raise a farm and a family. His childhood friend Hamish (Brendan Gleeson) is happy to challenge him to feats of strength at the wedding that Wallace wanders into, all while Wallace catches the eye of Murron (Catherine McCormack). There's a quick romance, they marry in secret to save them from sending her to the local lord for his sexual rights through prima nocta (ahistorical, but whatever), and she is murdered by the local magistrate when an English soldier tries to rape her, Wallace defends her, and she gets captured to lure him out.So begins the rabble-rousing inception to the rebellion against the English presence in Scotland, a mixture of personal and ideological reasons that led him into a fight that was brimming across the country for a while that Wallace sparked. That the personal reason is intimately tied into the ideological one around the ""rape, theft, and murder"" of England against Scotland that matches what happened to Wallace through Murron. It's the basic narrative storytelling that Gibson showed strong grasping of throughout his career, up through Apocalypto and Hacksaw Ridge. The opening half hour of romance flows naturally through to the rest of the film filled with battles.The battles get going after some expert setup of the situation as we watch Longshanks deal with his son Prince Edward (Peter Hanly) and his daughter-in-law Princess Isabella (Sophie Marceau) while Wallace is introduced to Scottish politics through mainly Robert the Bruce (Angus Macfadyen) whose father (Ian Brennan), is scheming on every side of every event, working towards Robert becoming king of Scotland. The nobles are constantly trying to get out of fights to negotiate for to increase their own lands. It's Wallace who comes into the situation, injecting it with a healthy dose of populist appeal for freedom (a gauzy use of the word that is more explicitly about Scotland being ruled by Scots...the same Scot lords that are constantly trying to sell out their people but more implicitly the Lockean ideal of personal liberty) that gets the people behind the revolt.And the battles are grandly staged. Before CGI gave us CGI armies, Mel Gibson dressed a few hundred people up in different uniforms and threw them at each other before going down the Chimes at Midnight route of capturing small snippets of battle to imply larger action through editing. The battles don't match to reality all that much (Stirling is missing the bridge, and the fire stuff at Falkirk is borderline nonsense), but they're incredibly well-filmed, staged, and they serve their narrative purposes very well. Stirling is Wallace's rise, and Falkirk is Wallace's fall, and it all comes together rather perfectly.The mythologization of Wallace has to include his martyrdom for the cause which, thankfully, has some basis in the reality of how Wallace actually died. I think it could have pushed the reality a bit further since Wallace ended up being one of the only prominent Scots who, after a series of battles leading to English dominance, refused to mark allegiance to the English crown, making him a particular object of hate for Longshanks. Instead, the film has him go on a course of vengeance against the Scottish nobles that betrayed him on the Falkirk battlefield, never quite getting far up enough in the chain to get to Robert the Bruce who convinces him to come in for talks, leading to his ultimate capture.It's really amazing how well all of this works and comes together, and a lot of that has to do with the actors. Gibson is a strong actor who became one of the biggest movie stars in the world, and he directs himself reasonably well, maintaining his accent strongly. He is a rootable underdog who has solid reasons for fighting his unwinnable fight, and Gibson is largely working on his charm. The rest of the cast is very good. Gibson is a very good actors' director, and he brings out great stuff from everyone involved from Marceau's woundedness and vulnerability turning into a veiled strength to Gleeson's bravado mixed with his earnest concern for Wallace's safety to David O'Hara as Stephen the Irishman and his mixture of being touched by God and vulgar and concerned as well. It's a very strong ensemble cast in support of Gibson's central character that helps fill out the edges of the action with detailed performances and adding to the overall verisimilitude.Gibson made a triumph of a film. A rousing entertainment that brought David Lean scale up to the 90s sensibilities filled with wonderful performances, well-filmed with a strong eye towards composition, and told on an epic scale. I think I might have been a bit torn about whether to vote for this or Apollo 13 for the Best Picture Oscar had I been a voter at the time, but Braveheart winning doesn't feel like any kind of steal. It feels earned.",23 December 2023

",8,"My old dad used to treat this Mel Gibson Best Picture Oscar-winner with utter scorn and derision, especially with reference to the actual facts as known. He always started off with the respective differences in size between the real William Wallace's true dimensions and the much less imposing Mel Gibson while anyone who does the mildest of diligence into the historical facts will see just how much licence director Gibson and his screenwriter Randall Wallace took with the Scottish rebel-hero's story. I know and knew all this even as I rewatched the film again but despite the overwhelming number of plot contrivances served up, I have to admit as an independence-leaning Scot myself, the film never fails to stir my own blood.We follow the young Wallace from his early childhood, almost literally blooded early in life to hate the occupying English army under the rule of their despotic King Edward Longshanks played with real brio by Patrick McGoohan. When he loses his father and older brother in another betrayal by Edward, it's clear that the now fully-grown, long-haired Wallace is only awaiting one final provocation before he accepts the freedom-fighter mantle and takes up the cudgels on behalf of his downtrodden people.For those who don't know very much about Scottish history, it is filled with glorious failures and almost as often double-dealing, back-stabbing intrigue so that it's no surprise when his heroics are brought to an end by a combination of underhand scheming on the part of Edward and the connivance of the corruptible nobility, in particular the treachery of the future Scottish hero - King, Robert the Bruce. But Wallace has the last word in more ways than one with his martyr's death and impregnation of the future English queen.Certainly one of Hollywood's more outrageous retellings of a story from history, the movie bludgeons its way into the viewer's consciousness down to the twin combination of Gibson's muscular, gritty direction and his athleticism and conviction in the lead role. Sure, the accents across the cast are occasionally as convincing as a King's promise, but with effective use of crowd scenes and the gory, no holds-barred depictions of battleground warfare, laced with earthy humour and even a good old Highland romance, Gibson delivers a powerfully uplifting if historically inaccurate feature which has thrilled the Scottish national psyche and no doubt the freedom-seeking aspirations of many another country ever since.",9 November 2023

",10,"For starters, this movie is a true story. The film is about two men who come from different social classes. One being Driss who is from the suburbs around the city, and Philippe who lives in the center of Paris. The narrative of this film begins with the last scene of the film at the beginning of the film. The movie essentially unfolds as a recollection leading up to this particular moment. Throughout the story, we learn that Driss serves as a caretaker for Philippe. As the plot progresses, their bond gradually transforms from a professional association into a deep friendship. From the first time watching this movie in 7th grade it has remained in my list of my all time favorite movies. Its significance is not solely due to French being my primary language, but rather stems from the profound morals and lessons that I have taken away from this movie. Throughout this movie life's challenges, compassion, and the inherent beauty that surrounds us, that we take for granted.I truly recommend this movie to everyone, but especially, to people who are learning the French language. I have gone to a French school for the majority of my life, so the way I was taught French is very different from those who have been taught in an American school teaching system. Something this movie has to offer for the people learning the language is the non textbook French. This movie accurately represents the French language of this generation. In other words it will greatly help with improving french speaking. Now for everyone else who is just watching to watch. This movie accurately represents French people and not by the negative stereotypes everyone constantly associates the French with (rude, mean etc..). The dark humor and the expressions in the dialogue is exquisite and hilarious. Watching this movie while being so far away from my french environment, makes me feel comfortable and at home.Although based on a true story, the actors portraying Philippe and Driss showcased remarkable talent in encapsulating the emotions and real-life experiences inherent in the making of a profoundly wholesome and authentic bond between two individuals. I find it fascinating how society categorizes both of them, and has deemed them as lower class. In the sense that Driss is just a lowlife, criminal that is untrustworthy, and Phillipe being deemed as incapacitated. Despite these biased perceptions of their background, they are people who are incapable of doing anything for themselves. Both of them together prove society wrong.Their unique friendship showcases to the public how two people from diverse backgrounds enriches a friendship, gives us experience and learns different things about each other, whether it was through them sharing their different music taste, or trying different activities for each other, and going out of their comfort zones. Through the respect they have fortified for each other. Driss treated Philippe like any other human, and not treating him differently because of his condition. While Philippe refrains from associating Driss with his past mistakes, acknowledging that everyone has the potential to grow and change, from the person they used to be in the past. Lastly, being there for each other emotionally, whether it was Philippe understanding and encouraging Driss to go back home and take care of his family that needed him. Or Driss being there for Philippe when he had his panic attacks, and soothing him.In essence, their relationship stands as a testament to the transformative power of friendship, breaking societal barriers and teaching us invaluable lessons about acceptance, empathy, and the capacity for personal growth. It also becomes a profound platform for mutual growth and learning. You most definitely will not regret spending one hour and fifty two minutes of your life watching this movie.",19 December 2023

",9,"Normally I am not the person to be impressed by overly sugary, saccharine, or light films. I think they can be corny, formulaic, and trite affairs. Which is probably why I felt pleasantly surprised when I viewed The Intouchables. There should be no qualms that this films intention is first and foremost, to make its audience laugh. The script is impeccably witty and very funny, aided by marvellous performances by Omar Sy and Francois Cluzet. Sy and Cluzet are a remarkable pairing, for they enjoy an unabashedly enjoyable, sometimes even riotously funny dynamic with each other. This is also to teh screenplays credit. Philippe is written as a character stripped of almost all pleasures in his life, which lends well for him to adopt a reckless attitude , or at least one reckless by French aristocratic standards, towards life. He is hence a perfect match for the often crude, and profane Driss. He is paralysed waist down, so he doesn't care if Driss talks to him at the opera, or insults or embarrasses his family members. This lends itself to wonderfully hilarious situations in the film, always maintaining a taut pace, and making thetwo hour duration an easy, engrossing, and engaging watch. But I doubt the film would score so highly if it were merely an overt comedy. Indeed what makes The Intouchables a great rather than a good film is its emotionally resonance. Driss and Philippe come from entirely disparate walks of life, and the director does not shy away from portraying both the decrepit, dirty blocks of ugly public housing and the lush, refined surroundings of Philippes home. Like what good friends do, Driss and Philippe helps each other with achieving self fulfilment, and it is interesting that this help rendered to each other originates not only from their common humanity, but also from their different backgrounds. Philippe helps Driss in discovering his talent for abstract art, and even manages to help him sell his painting, through his own wealthy connections of course. Meanwhile Philippe not only lacks the bravery and initiative to pursue Elenor, but also has trouble with his daughter. Driss, with his more direct and tougher personality, helps with encouraging Philippe to be more direct both in disciplining his daughter, and with chasing Elenor. Of course, part of the films appeal is that it balances drama and comedy deftly- the film never feels overly saccharine or overly sentimental. Instead it offers a measured blend of both. This is what makes The Intouchables a sublimely uplifting, yet hilarious watch.",3 December 2023

",9,"The Silence of the Lambs is an exceptional cinematic achievement that has stood the test of time, earning its place as a classic in the realm of psychological thrillers. Directed by Jonathan Demme and released in 1991, this film brilliantly captures the chilling atmosphere, intense performances, and intricate storytelling that make it a standout in its genre.Jodie Foster portrays Clarice Starling, a determined FBI trainee who is assigned to interview the infamous cannibalistic serial killer, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, played flawlessly by Sir Anthony Hopkins. From the very first moment they share the screen, the palpable tension between Foster and Hopkins is electrifying. Their chemistry is nothing short of mesmerizing, as Lecter's calm and manipulative demeanor effortlessly contrasts with Starling's vulnerability and determination.The screenplay, adapted from Thomas Harris' novel, is a masterclass in suspenseful storytelling. The plot revolves around Starling's pursuit of another twisted serial killer, Jame Gumb, known as Buffalo Bill. As Clarice delves deeper into the twisted psyche of these killers, she must rely on Lecter's help in order to unravel the mystery. The intricate cat-and-mouse game that unfolds is both gripping and disturbing, leaving the audience on the edge of their seats throughout.Demme's direction is nothing short of brilliant. His meticulous attention to detail is evident in every frame, creating an unnerving atmosphere that permeates the film. The use of close-ups and tight shots further intensify the psychological impact, allowing us to delve deeply into the characters' minds. The haunting and atmospheric score by Howard Shore perfectly complements the visuals, enhancing the overall sense of unease.In addition to Foster and Hopkins' exceptional performances, the supporting cast also shines. Ted Levine gives a chilling portrayal of the deranged Buffalo Bill, while Scott Glenn delivers a commanding performance as FBI agent Jack Crawford. Each actor brings depth and authenticity to their respective roles, making the characters feel real and enhancing the overall impact of the film.The Silence of the Lambs is not for the faint of heart. It delves into the darkest corners of the human psyche, exploring themes of obsession, manipulation, and the blurred lines between good and evil. It is a thought-provoking and disturbing cinematic experience that lingers long after the credits roll.While the film is a masterpiece in its own right, the only reason it falls short of a perfect 10/10 rating is due to a few minor flaws. Firstly, some viewers may find the graphic content and disturbing imagery too unsettling to handle, so it's not recommended for those with a weak stomach or easily triggered by violence. Additionally, the pacing occasionally slows down in certain scenes, which can be a bit distracting.However, these minor drawbacks pale in comparison to the film's overall brilliance. The Silence of the Lambs is a true masterpiece that deserves its place among the greatest films of all time. It showcases the power of exceptional storytelling, outstanding performances, and masterful direction. The film's impact extends far beyond the screen, as it continues to influence and inspire countless psychological thrillers that came after it.In conclusion, The Silence of the Lambs is a gripping and chilling journey into the depths of the human mind. With stellar performances, a meticulously crafted screenplay, and haunting visuals, it delivers an unforgettable cinematic experience. If you have a strong stomach and a taste for psychological thrillers, this film is an absolute must-watch. It is a true gem that will leave you questioning the boundaries of good and evil long after the credits roll.",1 January 2024

I actually didn't realise the film is mainly about a student police detective trying to catch a different serial killer called Buffallo Bill, with a bit of advice from Hannibal. Hannibal is a doctor, clearly very smart from the off and I suppose he's probably slightly used to the fact that the FBI would use him to think inside the mind of a serial killer/psychopath. I like the dark side of the film, a lot of gore shown within the film and not hidden from the watchers, as that can be frustrating sometimes. I like the whole concept but can't help but feel I'd rather see more of Hannibal, and more scenes like where he slips away from the FBI when in high security at the top of the hotel, brilliant scene.",30 December 2023

",9,"Ah, the fascinating case of the Lord of the Rings film trilogy! You're absolutely right - releasing The Fellowship of the Ring last and The Return of the King first was, to put it mildly, unconventional. There are a few reasons why Peter Jackson and the team made this seemingly confusing decision:1. Narrative Flow:
Jackson wanted to keep the momentum and tension high throughout the saga. Starting with the epic battle of Helm's Deep in The Two Towers immediately hooks viewers, making them desperate to understand how it came to this. Flashing back to the journey's beginning with The Fellowship then reveals the stakes and builds anticipation for the final showdown.2. Character Development:
The later films show characters more hardened and weathered by their experiences. Seeing them in this state first creates a sense of intrigue about their journey and how they got there. The Fellowship, in contrast, depicts their naivety and hope, adding a different emotional layer to their story.3. Thematic Emphasis:
The Two Towers and The Return of the King highlight themes of unity, sacrifice, and hope in the face of overwhelming darkness. Starting with these films emphasizes these messages, making The Fellowship's focus on friendship and innocence feel even more poignant.Of course, some argue that this narrative structure hinders understanding for first-time viewers. However, Jackson believed it would reward repeat viewings, allowing viewers to appreciate the foreshadowing and thematic connections across the films.Now, let's talk about the web series, The Rings of Power! Set thousands of years before the film trilogy, it explores the Second Age of Middle-earth. While different in tone and scope, it offers a deeper look into Tolkien's rich mythology and the events leading up to the rise of Sauron. It's exciting to see these new stories come to life, further expanding the vast tapestry of Tolkien's world.Ultimately, both the film trilogy and The Rings of Power offer unique and captivating experiences for Tolkien fans.

",10,"It's amazing how this film just fires on all cylinders for its entire runtime, from its quiet opening to its grand finale. It's kind of structured a bit weird, it's all kinds of trashy, but it's so impeccably made that it completely and easily overcomes all of that to become a real thrill ride of an experience. That it won Best Picture is some kind of miracle because the Academy had been awarding largely safe films for more than a decade, and The Silence of the Lambs represents something far less safe and somewhat outside of their standard awarded fare: quality genre filmmaking.Buffalo Bill (Tim Levine) has killed five women in the Midwest and MidAtlantic region of the US, and the FBI is getting nowhere with its investigation. So, it decides to establish a psychological profile of the man they have no idea who he is by interviewing serial killers they have in custody, including the notorious Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lector (Anthony Hopkins). The problem is that Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) is the man who caught Lector, so he sends the trainee Clarice Starling (Jodi Foster) in his place. It's a multi-faceted move, including the obvious edge of sending an attractive, seemingly frail young woman to beg for help from the man behind the glass who hasn't seen a woman in eight years.One of the most curious and effective elements of the film's construction is how immensely subjective it's filmed. The most obvious is the use of closeups where actors are looking directly into camera to create this eerie feeling in the audience that they're being watched. This usually happens in conversations with Starling where she doesn't do it, like in the first conversation with Crawford in his office, but she does stare into the camera for some of her conversations with Lector. It also extends into all of her experiences in the investigation, from a fellow inmate throwing...intimate substances into her face to the West Virginia sheriffs and deputies all towering over her, we see the whole thing from her perspective, and that perspective is kind of terrifying. She's physically unimposing, weaker than most people around her, and she has to stand toe to toe with people like Dr. Chilton (Anthony Heald), the warden of the prison who obviously wants to bed Clarice, as well as one of the most notorious serial killers in US history.The meat of the film is this psychological dance between Lector and Starling as they try to use each other for their own ends. Starling needs his insight into Bill, quickly learned to be much more since he end up having had a direct connection with him in his life before he was caught. Since she's the only person he'll talk to, but only under the condition that she reveal himself to her, Crawford allows her to go back repeatedly as the investigation continues, Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith), the daughter of Tennessee's junior senator, gets kidnapped by Bill, and things turn increasingly desperate.What's kind of weird about the film is that balance between the conversation with Lector and the investigation around Bill. The connective tissue between them is Clarice herself, and it's mostly a literal, mechanical connection since she ends up performing the final leg of the investigation herself. There's supposedly a connective tissue that's more thematic and character based in the story behind the film's title, her getting over a traumatic event from her childhood when, orphaned, she moved to Montana at 10 and ran away when she heard the slaughtering and crying of lambs at the farm. She's haunted by the sound of their crying which will supposedly get addressed when she deals with the missing Martin girl, but it's a tenuous connection that the film never really addresses. I only bring this up because the film works despite this instead of because of it. It works because it so firmly dedicates itself to the stylish telling of the two sides of the story, interweaving them expertly to build a cohesive experience overall.And that experience is all about that tension as the action and stakes ramp up with Miller getting her hand's on Bill's dog, Crawford leading a SWAT team into the wrong house, and Clarice asking some follow up questions that takes her to Bill's house, all right after Lector violently got himself out of prison. I also have to give the film real props for setting things up in a way for Clarice to go to Bill's house and have the extra information that would make her visit different from any potential previous visits from local police (the information about the moths). It's not hyped up or propped up, but it's there, enough to do what is necessary.It's really remarkable how well this film works, how it seemingly brings everything together (I really don't think the actual connection for Clarice between Lector and Bill works, but the film is so busy entertaining around that point that it doesn't really matter, almost like the source material was kind of trashy). I thought, more than once, of Robert Redford's Out of Africa, another kind of trashy story given prestige treatment, and I wondered why I felt like it worked here and not previously. I think the difference is that the prestige treatment for the silly romance in Out of Africa tried to remake the story into something that it wasn't naturally (a grand romance), while all the money and talent thrown into The Silence of the Lambs makes it the this pristinely made trashy thriller.Performances are great all around. The whole film rests on Foster's shoulders, and she carries herself pretty much perfectly, balancing fear, confidence, and self-doubt all at once. The flash is Hopkins as Lector, and he's great, getting into Clarice's head with just little twists of words, and his presence looms large on the whole film.It's a great entertainment, completely embracing its depths of the worst imaginings of the human condition while telling a compelling mystery and delivering the thrills.",23 December 2023

",9,"It's a legendary movie. By the way, I'm going to have Deceptive conversations now, so let me add this here. Tolkien designed this world perfectly. Tolkien started a new era for fantasy films. Maybe you are Harry Potter or maybe you are a Marvel fan. But one of the reasons why all of these films are Tolkien, anyway, let's not deviate from our topic. One of the reasons why this movie is a legend is that it brought the Avatar to us. James Cameron brought the avatar, I know that. But Cameron took this movie to a lot of producers and it wasn't accepted because of its budget. When the Lord of the Rings came out 7-8 years later, he had an increased belief that the Avatar could also be filmed now and started working. We have praised Tolkien so far. But does the director have no contribution at all? Of course there is. When you build a fantasy world, you set rules according to yourself, and Tolkien did it very well. But director Peter Jackson didn't do it that way, there's already enough information in the book, and he thought the world could tell itself. Let me add this about the movie. Gandalf and Frodo didn't actually have any scenes shot together. I recommend to everyone that what we saw together was also a montage, watch it as a family.",30 November 2023

",10,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a cinematic masterpiece that has stood the test of time as a psychological thriller. Released in 1991 and directed by Jonathan Demme, the film is an adaptation of Thomas Harris's novel of the same name. With an impeccable cast, led by Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins, the movie explores the dark realms of criminal psychology, creating an intense and unforgettable experience for the audience.At the heart of the film is the brilliant but haunted FBI trainee Clarice Starling, played by Jodie Foster. Foster's portrayal of Starling is nothing short of captivating. Her strength, vulnerability, and determination shine through as she navigates the male-dominated world of criminal profiling. The character's journey is a crucial element, and Foster's performance earned her an Academy Award for Best Actress, a testament to her ability to convey the complex emotions that define Clarice.The true star of the show, however, is Anthony Hopkins in his iconic role as Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Hopkins's chilling performance as the brilliant and manipulative cannibalistic psychiatrist is nothing short of legendary. His ability to portray Lecter's intelligence and charisma, coupled with an underlying sense of menace, earned him the Academy Award for Best Actor. The character has become a cultural icon, and Lecter's conversations with Clarice are some of the most memorable and psychologically intense moments in cinematic history.One of the film's strengths lies in its atmospheric tension. Demme masterfully creates an unsettling atmosphere that lingers throughout the narrative. The use of close-up shots, combined with Howard Shore's haunting score, contributes to a sense of unease that permeates every frame. The cinematography, handled by Tak Fujimoto, adds to the film's visual brilliance, creating a dark and ominous world that mirrors the psychological depths explored in the storyline.The narrative itself is a gripping psychological puzzle. The plot revolves around the pursuit of a serial killer known as Buffalo Bill, who kidnaps and murders young women. To catch him, Clarice Starling seeks the help of Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant psychiatrist turned incarcerated psychopath. The cat-and-mouse game between Starling and Lecter adds layers of complexity to the story, and the suspense is heightened by the parallel investigation conducted by the FBI.What sets ""The Silence of the Lambs"" apart is its exploration of the psychology behind criminal behavior. The film delves into the minds of both the investigators and the criminals, providing a nuanced understanding of the human psyche. The conversations between Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter, though disturbing, offer profound insights into the motivations and traumas that shape individuals. This psychological depth elevates the film beyond a conventional thriller, making it a thought-provoking exploration of the human condition.Beyond its psychological elements, the film also addresses issues of gender and power dynamics. Clarice Starling's journey as a female FBI trainee facing the challenges of a male-dominated profession adds a layer of social commentary. Her resilience and intelligence challenge traditional gender norms, making her a trailblazing character in the thriller genre.In conclusion, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" remains a cinematic triumph that has left an indelible mark on the thriller genre. With its exceptional performances, masterful direction, and psychological depth, the film continues to captivate audiences decades after its release. It is a testament to the enduring power of storytelling when coupled with stellar craftsmanship, making it a must-watch for anyone seeking a cinematic experience that transcends the boundaries of the genre.",21 December 2023

",8,"Just finished watching ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" and I'm still reeling from the intensity and brilliance of this cinematic gem. I can't help but pour my thoughts out on what has become an instant favorite. Strap in, because this psychological thriller is an unparalleled rollercoaster of suspense and storytelling prowess.Let's talk about Sir Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Hannibal Lecter. I mean, wow! His portrayal is beyond anything I could have imagined. The man's screen presence is both captivating and bone-chilling. Lecter's intellect, coupled with that eerie calmness, kept me on the edge of my seat throughout. Hopkins deserved every accolade, especially that Academy Award for Best Actor. It's a performance etched in my memory forever.Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling is nothing short of a revelation. Her vulnerability and determination create this perfect balance, making Clarice a protagonist you can't help but root for. The chemistry between Foster and Hopkins is electrifying, adding a layer of complexity to the narrative that's hard to put into words. Clarice's journey into the dark corners of criminal psychology is both compelling and, at times, downright unnerving.The storytelling here is a masterpiece. I love how the film weaves together crime procedural, horror, and psychological drama seamlessly. Every scene serves a purpose, and the pacing is spot-on. The tension builds steadily, reaching a crescendo in the final moments that left me breathless. The symbolism, especially with the recurring motif of moths, adds a layer of depth that I didn't expect from a thriller.Jonathan Demme's direction is something to behold. Those close-ups and point-of-view shots bring you right into the minds of the characters. And let's talk about the ""Lecter's cell"" scenes-the clarity in those shots is a stroke of genius. The man knows how to create an atmosphere, and the haunting score by Howard Shore only amplifies the experience. It's a visual and auditory feast that lingers long after the movie ends.What struck me most is the film's ability to challenge traditional gender roles. Clarice Starling is not your typical damsel in distress; she's a force to be reckoned with. Her journey isn't defined by romantic entanglements but by her pursuit of justice and self-discovery. It's refreshing and progressive, especially for a film of its time.As the credits rolled, I couldn't help but think about the lasting impact of ""The Silence of the Lambs."" Its influence on the thriller and horror genres is undeniable, and you can see echoes of it in so many films that followed. It's a cultural touchstone, a benchmark for psychological storytelling that sets the bar incredibly high.In conclusion, if you haven't seen ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" drop everything and do it now. It's a cinematic experience that's both chilling and thought-provoking. I can't stop thinking about it, and I'm sure it will haunt my dreams for a while. Hats off to everyone involved in creating this masterpiece.",17 December 2023

Having said that, there are aspects of it that stop it from being considered in the exalted company of great cinema.For one, the editing is a choppy in bits, moving from one scene to another rather abruptly. The titular characters motivations after achieving his main objective as a 'Baaghi' was not sketched out with one having to wonder, why does he keep doing this, what is the end goal. He's shown in too much of a positive light, which is a stark contrast to his actions. Probably, those bits were left on the editing table to make the film compact, but given the other wonderful aspects of the movie, you do wish that it was included somehow to give the story a sense of completeness.Now coming to the good parts. Irrfan, excellent as always. The way he emotes through his eyes and body language is probably the best in the industry, if not one of the best in the world. You can feel Paan Singh's pain, anger, fleeting joys and viciousness radiating out of him, even in silence. Although, I did express qualms about the choppy editing and missing bits, the overall story is well paced and told, at no moment, lagging in pace. The side characters do a good enough job in sketchy parts, but the movie about Paan Singh Tomar, sticks completely around the central character throughout the duration, and with Irrfan playing it to such excellence, I doubt if anyone would complain.Overall, it is a good film, that could have been an excellent film but for a few minor blips.

I would give it a solid 7 out of 10, not for its intricate plot but for being the Humphrey Bogart of movies - charming, a bit mysterious, and undeniably entertaining.Let's talk about the narrative twists. The plot might not stand up to rigorous scrutiny, but then again, Casablanca is more about capturing the essence of a turbulent era than meticulous storytelling. The ""letters of transit"" might sound like a convenient plot device, but they serve their purpose in keeping the tension alive.Choosing Casablanca as a backdrop for a love story amidst political chaos might seem curious, but it adds a layer of complexity to the characters. Renault's questionable ethics reflect the moral ambiguity of the time, even if it doesn't align with modern standards.The supporting cast is a vibrant mix of characters, from the rival nightclub owner Ferrari to the duplicitous police chief Renault, played with finesse by Claude Rains. Dooley Wilson's rendition of 'As Time Goes By' adds emotional depth to the film.Bogart and Bergman share undeniable chemistry, even if their characters are not as fully fleshed out as one might hope. Paul Henreid as Laszlo embodies the spirit of resistance, though his post-US plans remain a mystery.Casablanca, with its rose-tinted glasses and melodramatic crescendos, is a love letter to a bygone era. While it may not be a cerebral masterpiece, it captures the essence of wartime romance and sacrifice.Woody Allen celebrated Bogart's performance in 'Play It Again, Sam,' paying homage to Casablanca.

",6,"The film ""Casablanca"", which was released back in 1942, is certainly a classic cinematic work that still remains an integral part of American culture. Director Michael Curtis has created a unique atmosphere where the historical context is combined with an intriguing plot. At the center is Rick Blaine, beautifully performed by Humphrey Bogart, who leads a secluded life in the neutral city of Casablanca, located in Morocco during World War II.Acting in the picture is definitely one of the main strengths of this work. Humphrey Bogart perfectly conveys the emotions of his character, capturing his complexity and inner experiences. His laid-back charisma and impeccable playing style create the unique appeal of Rick Blaine. Especially impressive is his interaction with Ilsa Lund, whose image perfectly freezes in the viewer's memory. Thanks to Ingrid Bergman's good acting, Ilse's image turns out to be organic and definitely succeeded for the actress. I still can't understand why this duo didn't take the Oscars for the best male and female roles. Despite my reserved attitude to the picture as a whole, I think that Bogart and Bergman played well and could have become winners. And if the first one received a nomination, then Ingrid was not even awarded such an honor. A pity.The picture will certainly pose a lot of questions to the audience about who and how should have behaved in this story. Where and whose place, how to be, torn between feelings and duty, finally, what will happen after the choice is made, first of all, in the soul of the heroes. The film, directed by Curtis, will allow viewers to decide for themselves what is right and what is not.Despite all the positive aspects, it is worth noting that the picture seemed boring to me. I understand that my expectations played a negative role. I have heard a lot of extremely positive reviews about this film, and when I got to know the picture myself, the film seemed ordinary and not very remarkable. Despite the presence of romantic and dramatic moments, ""Casablanca"" sometimes slows down the pace, which can be explained in the historical context and the nature of the characters. However, this feature can hardly be defined as a disadvantage, since it is part of its unique atmosphere and helps to delve into the specifics of the events and experiences of the characters. But I, probably, as a modern viewer, saw a negative side and a protracted narrative in this.In conclusion, I would like to say that the film is a vivid example of classic Hollywood cinema. The acting of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman impresses with its strength and emotional depth. But everything else passed as if in the background. However, it is worth noting that ""Casablanca"" was and remains one of the most important works of cinema and undoubtedly deserves recognition and admiration. Let the film look quite simple and even predictable today, the picture will definitely find its audience. After all, this is a classic.6 out of 10.",19 November 2023

",8,"FILM: 8.5/10.Diving into 1941's Casablanca was like uncovering a hidden treasure chest in the cinematic seas. Much has been said of the film in the past eight decades, and for good reason. Sitting down to watch this classic, I quickly found myself immersed in a bygone era of wartime intrigue and timeless romance, where fedoras were a staple and every shadow held a secret.As the story unfolds, Humphrey Bogart's portrayal of Rick Blaine struck a chord with me-world-weary yet undeniably charismatic. His chemistry with Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund is the stuff of cinematic legend. Their on-screen dynamic balances the desires of their characters perfectly with the realities of war.The supporting cast is a treasure trove of memorable characters. Claude Rains as the charmingly corrupt Captain Renault adds a amusing layer of wit to proceedings, and who could forget Sam's soulful tunes at Rick's Café? The film's dialogue is a masterclass in wit and sophistication, with lines that have etched themselves into the very fabric of movie history. That's even more impressive given that no one involved knew they were making cinematic history. To the screenwriters this was merely one of six films they churned out in 1942.Casablanca may be a love story at first glance, but ultimately it's a tale of morality amongst the backdrop of a harrowing time in the world's history. The setting, a melting pot of conflicting interests and cultures, is perfectly captured in the microcosm of Rick's Café. The theme of sacrifice and that haunting, often repeated melody of ""As Time Goes By"" will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.In a world where flashy CGI often steals the show, Casablanca stands tall as a beacon of well-crafted storytelling.

",10,"Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse is a movie that follows teenager Miles Morales and his adventure into becoming Spider-man in his universe. That's right. His universe. After witnessing the Spider-man in his own universe tragically pass away, Miles Morales is given the chance to have his own superhero story. He was given a device by the recently deceased Spider-man and finds it his responsibility to avenge the hero. From there, he meets Peter Parker, except it's not the one who had died. This man happens to be from another universe. Miles ends up looking up to him as a mentor, even though the man refuses to bond with him. We also meet other Spider-people from other universes. Each one having their own theme that makes them different despite their similarities. Throughout the movie, we're shown again and again that the others look down on Miles. He's not ready yet. This gives a reason to cheer him on, and as the others see how determined he is, they start to bond with him, and in the end, accept him as one of their own. This movie has a lot of familial aspects in it, not only with Mile's biological family but also a found one, which is one of my favorite tropes.I honestly think this movie has multiple themes. It depends on how exactly you choose to look at the movie. On the one hand, you could say the theme is that it's always better to work in a team. The characters had to rely on each other to get what they wanted, which in this case was to get back to their own universes. They couldn't achieve what they wanted without each other, and specifically, without Miles, and what his skills brought to the table. On the other hand, you could choose to think of a specific quote said throughout the movie to represent the theme. A line that symbolizes what this movie is about. About having to keep going and do something meaningful, even if you don't know if you're ready for it yet. This quote is first said when Peter Parker tells Miles ""You won't. It's a leap of faith. That's all it is. A leap of faith."" When Miles asks when he'll know he's ready. It's such a powerful quote and it very obviously affects Miles very drastically. It's something that the viewer can internalize as well. There are also a lot of quotes that can fit into a theme, such as the quote from Stan Lee in response to the Spider-man suit fitting, ""It always fits, eventually."" I think it symbolizes that anyone can be Spider-man, which is actually reiterated at the end of the movie by Miles, where he says that anyone can wear the mask.The characters are just perfect. There's no other way to describe them. Even if all the main characters are different versions of the same character, they all have their own charm to them. Miles Morales. Someone who is determined to be true to his word and his promises, even if he has to go through pain and hardships to do so. Peter Parker. A man who despite being down on his luck, cheers on his friends and wants them to be their happiest, even if he has to lose something in the process. Gwen Stacey, or Spider-women. A girl who despite losing someone very dear to her and vowing to stay away from friendship, starts to warm up to the thought of it, and in the process, makes a friend that will stay with her for more than a lifetime. Peni Parker, a young child who lost her father and despite that, keeps going forward. Spider-ham, a comic relief character who cheers everyone up with his antics and cartoon-like persona. And last but absolutely not least, Spider-noir, who despite having a dark, mystery-esque persona, and living in the past, puts work in just the same as his counterparts. I love the fluidity that comes with a character such as Spider-man. There's so much you can do with such a simple backstory and superpower, which is why all these fantastic characters exist. They all have the same ""losing someone and using this grief to, instead of taking revenge, help people"" kind of backstory, but all of them are different, which develops characters who are driven by the same thing, but also different because they went through different things.Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse has such a complex plot. I mean, alternate universes? It's such a complex idea that would be hard to transfer into an easily understood movie for children. But this film does it so well! It has a plot that is easy to follow while still entertaining you and leaving you on the edge of your seat waiting for the next thing. I personally had to hold myself back from crying at certain points. They put Miles in situations where he's forced to show aspects of himself that you can both relate to and sympathize with.I would recommend this movie to anyone who asks, or even anyone who hasn't! The characters are complex, and they develop instead of being one-dimensional. You can relate to them on a deeper level after witnessing what they've been through. And the plot. I love any and all superhero movies, so I might be biased, but it was phenomenally written. I hope the next film lives up to its predecessor.",10 December 2023

These were sometimes re-adaptations in which the story started from the very beginning over and over again, in all of them the actor portraying the superhero changed, sometimes the action level and sometimes the character formation were kept in the foreground. In particular, the appearance of Andrew Garfield, just a few years after Spider-Man's satisfying journey that began with Tobey Maguire and Sam Raimi in 2001, raised the question of 'was it necessary' for many fans. After watching the films, this question became even more meaningful. The new series had almost no innovations to take place in the mind. After this failed attempt, a completely different interpretation came to the Avengers and Spider-Man. Much more adolescent, much more fun, much clumsier, much more sympathetic, etc. It looked like Spider-Man. Especially in this last Spider-Man, the phenomenon of 'changing generations and their demands/needs' was felt very clearly. After all, the generation that watched the series in 2001 was now 30 years old today. It was necessary to offer something new for children and teenagers aged 10-12 years. Along with the films that will be released in the coming period, as of now, there are very few complaints about Spider-Man Tom Holland.

In this movie he shows off his talents in slapstick and acrobatic humour as well as the masterful use of irony for shock value.Unfortunately, the stoccatto changes in plot and setting didn't help it much and it feels like a collection of shorts featuring this ""tramp"" character strung together.At first he's a factory worker where automatisation goes awry, then he's a jailbird, then some sort of burglar, and, most significantly throughout the second half of a movie, a romantic character.He's not a stable character, either. At one funny juncture in the movie, he threatens to acquire a house by ""any means necessary, even if I have to work!"" which would be funnier if he'd been established as a lazy slacker, but let us not forget the movie opens with him hard at work in full factory worker's habit in the first vignette. Really the only trait that accompanies him throughout is his tendency to get swept into situations against his will.It's also very difficult to make constant slapstick funny, especially in a live action movie. And this style of humour comes to have a necessarily patchy laugh factor when it's strongly relied upon in a film.I understand some attributed communist leanings to the film. A stretch of the imagination indeed. I wouldn't try to draw much deep sociopolitical commentary from this one. Nor do I agree that it deserves to be placed amongst the greats. It's a light entertainment piece that features a respectable comedic performance from Chaplin, namore, naless.Honourable Mentions: The Hour of the Pig (1993).

The factory boss is presented with a device which will significantly cut down on lunch time, and is tested on Tramp, with very little success.Unlike Chaplin's previous work where he was naturally funny, I found (most of) the humour in 'Modern Times' a bit slapstick, almost forced. Back then it probably had the audience roaring with laughter. At least there were still more than enough delightfully funny moments in true Chaplin style. I admire the production for its innovative inventions.When Tramp suffers a nervous breakdown - probably due to the monotony of his job - he wreaks havoc in the factory. The scene where he falls into a machine, was incredibly well done with an amazing production design. Having lost his job, Tramp is later mistaken for a Communist leader and imprisoned.The film is also the story of a young, unemployed woman, Ellen - played by Paulette Goddard. I really enjoyed this character, who always seemed happy despite her dreary circumstances. She is an inspiring character, and I thought Paulette Goddard had a very modern look considering the time when the film was made.When Tramp and Ellen meet, they fantasize about a good, happy life together - living in a quaint little house with plenty to eat. I enjoyed them working towards realizing their dream, and being blissful about trivial things.'Modern Times' is interesting in the sense that it is a part talkie/part silent film. The characters themselves never speak, except for the factory boss over the monitor, and some instructions being read aloud, and various other sounds - and even a scene in a restaurant where Tramp performs a song!There is a lot happening in this film, and it almost felt like an anthology film, but in the end everything tied perfectly together.

rw9467997,ur1964495,tt0027977," An essential, timeless classic - both funny and heartfelt, and all too enduringly relevant
",10,"There's not possibly any missing that this picture pointedly zeroes in on the hustle and bustle and inhumanity of modern life; the general oppressiveness of industry and employers, and the specific oppression and dehumanization of workers and the common man; and not so fictional sci-fi dystopian notions and visuals - giant machines looming over the small people that are ground between them, state violence, social unrest, life on the streets in a fast-paced society that leaves the common folk behind, and more. It frankly would have taken startlingly little modification for this to have been fashioned into not just an unremittingly dour drama but even a discrete horror film (and truthfully, I wouldn't mind seeing some enterprising filmmaker do just that). Yet it really says so much about the genius of Charlie Chaplin that he's able to take these ideas and fashion them into a feature of such boisterous, irreverent energy that it has been hailed time and again not just as an enduring classic, but as one of the best comedies ever made. Seizing creative control as producer, writer, director, star, composer, and co-editor, there's no mistaking that this is Chaplin's baby. Personally I'm inclined to think some of his other works leave a bigger impression, yet to whatever extent there's any difference from one to the next, it surely has more to do with the supreme quality of those other works more than any specific failing on the part of 'Modern times.' One way or another this is superb, and something that everyone needs to see at least once!Rest assured that the same traits that defined the reverie of 'The circus,' 'The Gold Rush,' or 'The kid' are here in abundance here, too. We're treated to a cavalcade of gags and physical comedy amidst plentiful situational humor, not to mention exaggerated acting of which Chaplin's highly animated Tramp is the keystone. This is most certainly a joy - and at the same time, it's depressing yet heartfelt as it addresses major social issues. There is earnest, important storytelling here, with substantial, critical themes, that ninety years on remain infuriatingly, despairingly relevant, not least the enforcement and maintenance of harmful social, political, and economic systems at all costs rather than for one moment take any steps toward helping the needy, uplifting the marginalized, or righting the wrongs and inequalities of the world. And despite all that, Chaplin is invigorating and earns some definite laughs; despite all that, Paulette Goddard is unfailingly charming and sympathetic, giving such a tremendous performance that she threatens to outshine the man himself even as she has less time on-screen. The movie runs the gamut from riotous, to heartwarming, to dreary and dispiriting, and back again, and all the while the conglomeration is so expertly crafted that it never feels imbalanced, or too heavy-handed, or too light. The great success of 'Modern times' lies not in utmost hilarity, but in the absolute sincerity and heart that it boasts at all times, lightened at the exact right times and in the exact right ways by the exact right type and amount of good-natured silliness. And that, I think, might make this more brilliant that would be the case were it an outright frivolous romp.Through every mood and complex thought herein the flick is fabulously well made in every way from start to finish. The sets are huge, detailed, and highly impressive; every stunt and effect is ingenious and impeccable. The choice to stitch together select sound effects, dialogue, and music with the use of intertitles and a predominant silent presentation is marvelously endearing and speaks to the lasting value of cinema before the advent of talkies. Ira H. Morgan and Roland Totheroh's cinematography is stupendous, with some moments being especially smart, and likewise the editing of Chaplin and Willard Nico; Chaplin's score is sharp and lively in contributing to the vitality of the viewing experience. The narrative is absorbing, compelling, satisfying, and rewarding, with relatable and sympathetic characters, and the scene writing is exceptional in laying the groundwork for one rich, spellbinding beat after another, whether it's one of high-flying spirits or wholehearted, impactful drama. To that same end, Chaplin's direction is pretty much nothing less than extraordinary, illustrating a dexterity and mindfulness that allows every inclusion to achieve the maximum intended effect. As if to illustrate the point of all this lofty praise: for all the ups and downs of the picture in the preceding length, in the very last moments 'Modern times' swerves into a single scene of such momentous, soulful vibrancy - at once countermanding the comedy and drama, yet also flowing directly from it - that it becomes inescapably emotional, concluding the affair with an ending so perfect that I wonder if it doesn't even outshine that of 'City lights.'I can understand how older films don't appeal to all viewers, and how some folks may have a hard time engaging with such fare. I would have said the same of myself at one time. Some features exist outside such concerns of personal preference, however, be it because of how funny they are, how lasting and meaningful the story is, possibly just because they are so roundly well made, or even because they have earned a reputation over time. This is an example where all these statements are true. In every capacity, this film released in 1936 genuinely demands viewership, and that remains so no matter who you are. Without going into even more extensive detail about every tiny odd and end, what more is there to say? While I do still think some of Chaplin's other flicks hold more favor in my eyes, with the level on which the man operated, the distinction is meaningless. You need to make time for 'Modern times,' and that's all there is to it.",1 December 2023

After seeing the progress of a flock of sheep, the flock is replaced by blue collars coming out of the subway. The blue-collar workers, who are portrayed as a big flock of sheep trying to keep up with their jobs in the factory, are told how they have become slaves of the system in the special of the worker portrayed by Chaplin. Modern Times, which was published 13 years before the publication of George Orwell's 1984 novel, portrays a factory that may have been an inspiration to Orwell. The workers working in this factory, every corner of which is monitored by cameras and every movement of the workers is interfered with, are not yet aware of their importance in the system. Chaplin explains that the main cogs that keep the system afloat are the blue collars with the most iconic scene of the film. This scene looks like an accident, but in fact it happens due to the ambition of fast production of the company manager who oversees the automatic Decoction machine so that production is not interrupted even at lunch. The Worker, played by Caplin, is crushed under an excessive workload that he cannot handle, but still cannot leave the factory without going completely crazy.It stands out as a small representation of the Great Depression that the worker subverts the entire order of the system that he was still a part of before he left the factory from the inside, and no one has the power to stop it. From a macro point of view, it was the system itself that used the system's deficits with great ambition, and as a result, the biggest economic crisis America has ever seen broke out; there is no functioning economic system left. When the worker breaks down the system and leaves the factory, he is still under the influence of what he has experienced, and this situation begins to affect the street on this axis as well. In the continuation of the film, Chaplin gives place to the hardship of unemployment and hunger. The fact that the worker starts to march in front of the workers who are fighting for rights and the subsequent police intervention allows us to face the law. Our Worker who goes to prison encounters the formalization tactics of the system he was exposed to outside again. The most striking part of the prison episode is that while under the influence of drugs, he empathizes with the lawmen and helps them. The fact that the Worker, who lives more comfortably than the life he will live outside during his time in prison, does not want to remain free is also a guide for measuring the unemployment and hunger dimension.In the sequel to the film, Chaplin moves his window to a more social environment. He turns his camera to a street girl who is trying to overcome her desperation by getting support from her family's happiness. The story of this girl, who ran away from social services after the death of her father, bears a close resemblance to the story of Jean Valjean. Just as Victor Hugo described, he is wanted for arrest by the police because of a loaf he stole. While the system appeared as the capital at the beginning of the film, the state and law enforcement agencies assume its role in the sequel of the film. The worker and the Street Girl who ran into him and ran away from the police together are finally starting to dream the American Dream. However, realizing this dream is not so easy.The parts where Workman, who found a job as a night guard in a shopping mall and now starts living with Street Girl, spends time in the shopping mall can be interpreted as Chaplin's method of symbolizing consumption. Thanks to these scenes, Chaplin, who has moved from production to consumption, likens the danger of debt to a great abyss that is constantly being navigated on its shore. In these scenes, the ""Danger"" warning that never disappears from the screen and the fact that the space in the middle of the shopping center is surrounded by no railing can be shown as details that support this interpretation. The thieves who entered the shopping center at night said, ""We are not thieves, we are hungry."" his sentence is also an indication of how far the American Dream is from reality. The worker is arrested again for not doing his job properly. The state continues to appear as an enemy every second in the film. When the worker gets his freedom again, the Street Girl gives him the good news that he has found a home. One step closer to the American Dream. Although it has ceased to be a dream now, this dream is still very far away. But to learn from a news report in the newspaper that the factories have reopened, it would be a hope again.Charlie Chaplin cinema is not temporally stable. The time that passes between the events may seem too Deceptive, but this situation is parallel to the humorous jargon of the film. In modern Times, when the worker re-enters the factory, the workers go on strike on the same day. This is a naive explanation of how volatile and unstable the political and economic atmosphere is.Modern Times, following the development of the entertainment industry, change the class it focuses on again. Chaplin criticizes the upper-class people's understanding of entertainment and the upper-class entertainment industry, which exists even in a crisis environment, with a dance scene. When he sings with completely made-up lyrics, he is showered with applause by the audience who do not understand what is actually happening. It gives a glimpse into the world of these comfortable people who do not know and do not care what they are applauding. In addition, looking at the issues of hunger and unemployment that are focused on throughout the film from the point of view of the upper stratum, Chaplin draws attention to how many different troubles exist.Modern Times, which strongly emphasizes that the authority does not leave behind any cases where the power pursues it rightly or unjustly, is a classic that clearly shows the struggles of a collapsed economic order. The performance of Paulette Goddarg, who very successfully accompanies the characteristic performance of Charlie Chaplin, also feeds the film. Chaplin's unflinching attitude, combined with his experience as a filmmaker, results in a masterpiece like Modern Times.",30 November 2023

",7,"The so-called ""Little Tramp"" was Charlie Chaplin's most beloved on-screen character. The figure, which became a veritable icon worldwide, was created when Chaplin worked for Mack Sennett's famous Keystone Studios. This was during the silent film era and the Tramp was first seen in the one-reeler ""Mabel's Strange Predicament"" in 1914. Soon the guy was the star in the studio's company of players. Chaplin then continued to play his character in more than fifty short films. In full, feature-length productions however, he only appeared four times.In 1927, ""The Jazz Singer"" became the film that introduced ""the talkies"" to the world. As expected, it didn't take long until silent movies were practically gone from the silver screen. When Chaplin began to prepare a new production in the mid-1930s, he was therefore advised to go with the flow. But the great comedian knew that the Little Tramp's appeal would be lost if he had to speak. Consequently, Chaplin insisted on making the picture without any dialogue.In addition to starring in ""Modern Times"", Charlie Chaplin produced and directed the movie himself. He then spent a whole year in his own Hollywood studio, shooting the piece after his own screenplay. The film's highly stylized look was due to the fact that it was shot with 18 frames per second (the standard for silent film) but was shown at 24 frames per second (the standard for talking pictures). This, of course, made the slapstick comedy even more frantic.Many leading critics consider ""Modern Times"" to be Charlie Chaplin's last ""silent"" film. Even though the director used both sound, vocal and musical effects throughout. Still, after more than three years in production, ""Modern Times"" became a great, international success for the director. One of the signature works of his career, even. But sadly, it was also the last time the cinema audience got to see the Little Tramp up on the silver screen.",13 November 2023

Directed by the Wachowskis, this sci-fi masterpiece combines mind-bending concepts, stunning visual effects, and philosophical depth to create a cinematic experience that continues to captivate audiences.The story follows Thomas Anderson, a computer programmer who goes by the alias Neo (Keanu Reeves), as he discovers that the world he knows is a simulated reality-a computer-generated dream created by sentient machines that have enslaved humanity. Neo joins a rebellion led by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) to free humanity from the Matrix and uncover his true destiny as ""The One.""""The Matrix"" captivated audiences with its groundbreaking visual effects, including the iconic ""bullet time"" sequences, which redefined action cinematography and set a new standard for visual storytelling. The film's innovative use of CGI and martial arts choreography created a visually stunning and immersive experience.Beyond its technical achievements, ""The Matrix"" is rich in philosophical and existential themes. It delves into questions of reality, free will, and the nature of control, inviting audiences to contemplate the boundaries between perception and truth.The performances, particularly Reeves as the reluctant hero Neo and Fishburne's enigmatic Morpheus, anchor the film's narrative with gravitas and conviction. The chemistry among the cast members and their dedication to their roles contribute to the film's enduring impact.The film's cultural influence extends far beyond the silver screen, permeating into popular culture and inspiring discussions on technology, consciousness, and the nature of existence.

Which is not what you ever expected.First, it starts out by laying out the foundation of the family, their financial situation and personalities. The apartment not even in ground floor. Later comes the Rock which is the curse and the blessing in my opinion. Gave them the opportunities and then chaos.Second the parallel, the other family, a community and class very different than theirs. From being jobless to them all employed in this house. They are servants in a family that is a naive high class family who clearly due to their financial situation, are very very naive. However, due to the financial gain, they try desperately not to lose their jobs.After that, their personalities change, especially as the father is disgusted by the upper class view and nativity. Every character at this point has his own views that changed. After that the hidden basement occurred and CHAOS!.The story doesn't just keep you hanging, the ending is amazing too. The climax which gets out of control and then the family reunites in the same house.Something I noticed which made me admire this movie is the directing and cinematography.

Following in the footsteps of ""Seinfeld"" (which the movie utilizes for humor throughout, and being it's indirectly New Line, it, hence, is owned by WB indirectly nowadays), ""GoodFellas"" (with its very Scorsese-like opening), and ""Clerks"" in terms of the slacker culture (as the movie employs a very punk-like attitude for the first half before it gets more established and movie-pretty), in a very dark way that could have inspired ""Vulgar"" just a year later (also a Smith film), it's a true UPN/Warner Bros./WB flagship movie (maybe not downright glorious like narrow shield WB UPN/Warner Bros./WB flagship but it still has the magic that makes a true WB movie a true WB movie, including being ""Looney Tunes""ish, maybe not in this movie, but it's inevitable when you're a Warner Bros. Production, with some movies being Brooklyn-like borderline, although not this movie). Ironically, our main villain/big boss villain has the same name, if that isn't funny enough.The movie takes you deep into the world of everyone's fear of the same thing that allowed for the creation of the Borg, as a race of alien humanoid/biological hybrids on ""Star Trek TNG"" (although this is more like ""Voyager"" in this one). The movie plays with your mind. See it. The movie opens with a mysterious girl being set on a mission by the mysterious man named Morpheus. She kills several cops. In it we get introduced to important characters. A brilliant use of showing, not telling is done, in which the main head of the investigation, known at first only as Smith, chastizes a cop for not following order. Feeling patronized, the cop rips him a new one. Smith reminds him that the orders are for his protection, but what the movie shows is Smith, who ends up being a menacing villain, is actually, somewhat pooping in his pants, figuratively. The movie is showing something big is coming just with the shot. Smith is literally unnerved by this girl's actions, and the directors don't insult our intelligence, making it a big plus. Without Smith, the actual real people trapped are nasty people, and indirectly this movie mocks The WB and Tribune (not ironically, AOL, which is borderline Tribune-ish, bought WB in 2001, although it was nothing like Tribune's attempt, hence why their network never got popular like UPN, all 11 years, to remake WB in their own image). A pro-UPN movie.As the movie goes we see Thomas Anderson (played by Keanu Reeves). It becomes very clear, however, that this world is not what it seems. Then the mysterious girl from before, named Trinity, runs into Thomas. All Hell breaks loose. And Smith pays Thomas a visit. At this point Thoma's assent into herodom begins. It's an interesting morality play of teamwork, friendship, fellowship, romance featuring an ensemble cast of some of the best actors, Lawrence Fishburne (and this is the role that catipulted him to worldwide fame), Keanu Reeves, Carrie Ann Moss. Interestingly enough, Hugo Weaving is somewhat overshadowed as he never got the big fame the major 3 did. But his role is unforgetable. Major sound design is well-done in this movie. Another THX-worthy movie (and comically making me ask again why haven't any WB media releases ever got a THX sound certification? ""Twister"" - the most Tribune non-WBish of all the movies - is the only one to date). See it to believe it. BTW, all this crap about Morpheus being a ""magic negro"" is crap. He idolized by Neo the entire first half of the movie, and while Keanu dominates more starting the second, it is Morpheus who teaches Neo is everything he needs to know. Also Morpheus is older which is why he can't be the one. There is no subserviance from him to Neo at all.",1 January 2024

The film is based on real events, and this fact immediately hooked me, since such films have always caused me only positive emotions. It can be seen that everything in the film is as idealized as possible, and the emphasis is only on the relationships of the main characters, but still it's worth watching the film to remember once again that you need to believe in goodness and love, and even more to believe that there are men in our world who are ready to live for the sake of children and give them their love.The film itself tells how in 1950 the main character Suleiman, along with Turkish troops, was sent to Korea to participate in the Korean War. And while on patrol, he finds a little girl whose whole family died. The girl didn't say anything, so the soldiers started calling her Ayla. Knowing nothing about the upbringing of children, Suleiman, however, is completely immersed in taking care of Ayla and, naturally, this leads to the fact that he becomes attached to her as a daughter. Of course, one could say - there was no need to get attached, but they pulled the child out of the horror of the war. Therefore, Suleiman and his wife are heroes in my eyes, because all these years they have not given up and fought to find Ayla, their named daughter.If we talk about the acting master class, then I would like to single out the girl - the main character. At first glance, there is a feeling that the child is somewhat sedentary, insensitive and just does what her told. But when you look into her eyes, you feel unselfish love, warmth, peace, wisdom in them, and they have such sincerity and life that is ready to calm an adult and make them believe in the best, even though the fact is that tanks and machine guns are rumbling behind their backs.If we talk about the work of the director and cameraman, there are no bloody scenes in the film, or scenes with elements of violence, nor do they show excerpts of how someone was torn apart by explosions, of course there are scenes with murder, but they are shown casually and not in close-up, it would be impossible to do without them, everything-still a film about the war and the events that took place during that wartime. The scenery in the film is military-field, which can be dug up wherever there is land, so almost the entire film only shows slums, poverty, devastation, land.Summing up, we can say that it turned out to be a really correct and very strong film, which I advise you to watch unequivocally and without any doubt.",10 September 2022

",7,"""The Matrix"" (1999) is a groundbreaking film that transcends traditional boundaries of science fiction, blending philosophical depth with groundbreaking visual effects to create a cinematic experience that continues to resonate more than two decades after its release.Directed by Lana and Lilly Wachowski, ""The Matrix"" introduces us to a dystopian world where artificial intelligence has enslaved humanity by trapping their minds in a simulated reality, known as the Matrix. The protagonist, Neo, played by Keanu Reeves, is a computer hacker who discovers the truth about the Matrix and joins a group of rebels led by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) to break free from this illusion.One of the film's strengths lies in its exploration of philosophical concepts. ""The Matrix"" delves into questions of reality, free will, and the nature of existence. The iconic red pill-blue pill dilemma becomes a metaphor for the quest for knowledge and the willingness to confront uncomfortable truths. The Wachowskis skillfully weave these philosophical themes into the narrative, inviting viewers to ponder the nature of their own reality long after the credits roll.The film's visual effects, especially for its time, were revolutionary. The use of ""bullet time"" technology, where the camera seemingly freezes while the action continues around it, became iconic and has been emulated in numerous films since. The Wachowskis, along with cinematographer Bill Pope, successfully translated the mind-bending concept of the Matrix into a visually stunning reality. The green-tinted hue associated with the Matrix itself became an instantly recognizable visual motif.Keanu Reeves' portrayal of Neo is a highlight of the film. His journey from a skeptical computer hacker to the chosen one destined to challenge the Matrix is both compelling and believable. Reeves brings a sense of vulnerability and determination to the role, making Neo a relatable hero for audiences. Laurence Fishburne's Morpheus exudes wisdom and conviction, providing a strong mentor figure for Neo and anchoring the film's philosophical undertones.The supporting cast, including Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity and Hugo Weaving as the menacing Agent Smith, contribute significantly to the film's success. Moss brings a combination of strength and vulnerability to Trinity, while Weaving's cold and calculated performance as Agent Smith makes him a memorable antagonist. The chemistry between the cast members enhances the overall cohesion of the film.Beyond its philosophical and visual achievements, ""The Matrix"" is known for its cultural impact. The film's iconic scenes, such as Neo dodging bullets in slow motion or the lobby shootout, have become embedded in popular culture. The Matrix's influence extends beyond cinema, shaping discussions in fields like philosophy, technology, and even fashion.The film's soundtrack, composed by Don Davis, complements the futuristic atmosphere with a mix of electronic and orchestral elements. The music enhances the tension during action sequences and adds emotional depth to key moments, contributing to the overall immersive experience.While ""The Matrix"" received critical acclaim, it's not without its detractors. Some argue that the film's philosophical elements are too heavy-handed, overshadowing the narrative. Others criticize certain aspects of the plot for being convoluted or derivative. However, these criticisms are subjective, and many viewers appreciate the film precisely for its ambitious exploration of complex ideas.In conclusion, ""The Matrix"" remains a cinematic milestone that has left an indelible mark on the science fiction genre. Its innovative visual effects, thought-provoking themes, and memorable characters contribute to its enduring legacy. The film's impact extends beyond the screen, influencing subsequent films and sparking discussions about the nature of reality. As we approach its 25th anniversary, ""The Matrix"" continues to be a relevant and compelling piece of filmmaking that stands the test of time.",15 December 2023

rw9534036,ur175007506,tt0021749," A Silent Masterpiece. A Contender For Chaplin's Best Film.
",10,"In regards to silent cinema, the first name that usually comes to mind is usually a tossup between either Buster Keaton or Charlie Chaplin, who in their own rights, were both masters in their field, as they both created some of the best and most well-known films in the history of cinema. As for what I would say is my favorite of Chaplin's films, it would probably be this one, as it's a film that could not possibly be any better than it is, it's perfect in every conceivable aspect.City Lights is a flawless film that may very well be the best thing that Charlie Chaplin made. The film is funny, heartwarming, and filled with a sense of pathos. More specifically, the movie contains trademark Chaplin comedy, as the funny scenes are genuinely funny and are certain to make the audience laugh, however, the dramatic moments are indeed dramatic, which showed that Chaplin could be extremely versatile in his abilities as a filmmaker, one who was capable of bringing out the laughter and the feels.The film stars Chaplin as his iconic persona as The Tramp. In this film, the Tramp meets this young flower girl that he falls in love with, and, upon discovering that she's unable to see, becomes determined to help her. Eventually, he crosses paths with a millionaire, and this may potentially lead to him reaching his goal. Throughout the course of the film, plenty of hilarious moments ensue, while at the same time, so does quite a bit of the aforementioned sense of pathos, which combine to make what one might consider to be one of the most beautiful films ever made, and probably the finest of Chaplin's career.Chaplin's Tramp character is much like the other films that said persona appeared in, he's the average individual who gets caught up in situations, both funny and dramatic. Some of the funny moments include the beginning where he gets entangled on a statue and has a hard time trying to get down. There's also a scene where he gets a job as a street cleaner, and tries to wash his hands while one of his co-workers is trying to make a sandwich, which results in the co-worker accidentally eating a bar of soap. Then there's also the hilarity of one of the most famous scenes in the film, a boxing match in which the Tramp competes in to win money to help the aforementioned blind girl, a match that doesn't go according to plan. However, like I also said, there are some more dramatic moments to them, which as I also said before, showcases Chaplin's versatility.In addition to Chaplin, there's also some great supporting performances. Among said roles include Harry Myers, who plays the millionaire who becomes friends (well, depending on what frame of mind he's in) with the Tramp, and even becomes something of an assistant to him in is mission to help the girl he loves. However, the best one after Chaplin would have to be Virginia Cherrill, who plays the blind girl that Chaplin becomes determined to help. Their interactions with each other are probably among the most touching I've seen in any movie, because even though they have problems understanding each other due to the girl's blindness, one can still feel a sense of compassion amongst the two, which leads to one of the most heartwarming endings in cinema. The ending of the film (and I won't say what it is), which has been talked about for decades, is one that will definitely move the audience (if not more).Ultimately, City Lights is a breathtaking, funny, and very moving experience that definitely has a tendency to captivate those who view it. While I definitely would recommend this masterpiece to those who have yet to see it, I would not recommend it if they're discovering silent films for the first time, because while the film is outstanding, the sense of pathos might prove to be too much for first time silent film viewers. If that's the case, then some of the films of Buster Keaton or Harold Lloyd would be perfect for entering the silent foray, and if that proves to work, then give Chaplin a try, as his movies are among the finest of all time. Some might debate that there are better films that Chaplin made, while at the same time, there are probably those who would say that this is his best, which is a sentiment that I can definitely agree with. If you see this film, and you end up being entranced by it, then you've seen one of the best movies from the era, and it would also be no overestimation to say that it's one of the best films of all time.",1 January 2024

Set in a small Sicilian village, the film is a nostalgic coming-of-age story that explores the power of cinema and the enduring bonds of friendship.The main character is Salvatore ""Toto"" Di Vita, played by Salvatore Cascio as a boy and Marco Leonardi as a young man. Toto is a young boy who develops a deep love for the movies after being taken under the wing of the local projectionist, Alfredo, portrayed by Philippe Noiret. Alfredo becomes a mentor and father figure to Toto, teaching him about life, love, and the magic of the silver screen.The film beautifully captures the themes of love, loss, and the passage of time. It showcases the transformative power of cinema and how it can shape and influence our lives. It explores the complex emotions of nostalgia and the bittersweet longing for the past.The review of ""Cinema Paradiso"" would be incomplete without mentioning its deeply emotional tone. The film has a certain melancholic beauty that resonates with viewers. It leaves a profound impact by depicting the innocence of childhood and the sacrifices we make for our dreams. The ending, in particular, is a poignant gut-punch that leaves many viewers in tears.One scene that always brings tears to my eyes is when Toto watches a reel of censored kisses that Alfredo had cut from the films over the years. As Toto sees the powerful emotions displayed on screen, he realizes the depth of Alfredo's love for him and the sacrifices he made for his happiness. It evokes a mix of sadness, gratitude, and a longing for lost moments.The most iconic quote from the film is Alfredo's wise words to Toto: ""Living here day by day, you think it's the center of the world. You believe nothing will ever change. Then you leave: a year, two years. When you come back, everything's changed. The thread's broken. What you came to find isn't there. What was yours is gone. You have to go away for a long time... many years... before you can come back and find your people. The land where you were born. But now, no. It's not possible. Right now, you're blinder than I am.""One of the important lessons viewers may miss is the idea that life is fleeting and we must cherish the moments we have. The film encourages us to appreciate the simple pleasures and relationships in our lives, as they may not last forever.""Cinema Paradiso"" touches on the philosophical concepts of nostalgia, the passage of time, and the role of art in our lives. It invites us to reflect on the impact of film and how it can shape our perceptions and memories.If you enjoyed ""Cinema Paradiso,"" you may also appreciate other Italian films such as ""La Dolce Vita"" and ""The Great Beauty."" Additionally, books like ""The Dreamers"" by Gilbert Adair and ""The Film Book"" by Ronald Bergan delve into the power of cinema and its effects on our lives.Overall, ""Cinema Paradiso"" is a deeply moving and visually stunning film that will leave a lasting impression on anyone who watches it.

Sometimes, it's worth it, and you become a big-time filmmaker, and sometimes, you realize that what really matters is the people you love and the simple joys of life. But it's also a love letter to the magic of cinema. It's the kind of film that reminds you why you fell in love with the silver screen in the first place. One moment, you're wiping away tears of sentimentality, and the next, you're chuckling at the absurdity of it all. It's like a rollercoaster of emotions, but instead of screaming in terror, you're laughing out of sheer delight.But what really steals the show is the music. Ennio Morricone's score is like the icing on the cake, or in this case, the mozzarella on the pizza. It's emotional, it's beautiful, and it's the kind of music that makes you want to hug someone.In the end, Cinema Paradiso is a cinematic masterpiece that will tug at your heartstrings, tickle your funny bone, and leave you with an insatiable craving for gelato. It's a film that reminds us of the transformative power of storytelling and the enduring magic of the silver screen. It's a real slice of Italian heaven!",9 September 2023

",8,"It's a world of wonder that Guiseppe Tornatore transports us back to in Cinema Paradiso - a time and place where trips to the local cinema were the only form of escapism from the scarcities of post-WWII life in the village of Giancaldo, Sicily. This is where little Toto (Salvatore Di Vita) falls in love with the movies and everything they represent. Soon, the cinema's projectionist Alfredo (Philippe Noiret) recognizes this and welcomes Toto in to cultivate his passion for the big screen. Tornatore's direction, as well as the acting, is so stylized and melodramatic that it borders on the counterproductive, but the film has an irresistible enthusiasm and warmth which sucks you in. It's a celebration of movies in general, and more specifically the glory days of the cinema. Cinema Paradiso is at its best when it revolves around young Toto, who is the heart and soul of the film. His spontaneity evokes reminiscing of those wonder years of childhood and the time period in question, for those who were lucky enough to experience it. And the bittersweet ending may be self-indulgent, but it's also poetic. Winner of Best Foreign Language Film at the 62nd Academy Awards.",7 August 2023

The tramp was just a normal guy at first, but then, he suddenly started to try to protect her by finding money. This movie can show how much a man may love a girl, because he didn't care if he was the W word which is something I can't mention. I think they are one of my favorite relationships in fiction.

In this film, the elements of comedy and tragedy were used in their proper place and without exaggeration. Only the element of tragedy seemed to stand out a little more. Chaplin, who does not neglect to question things in his films, also questions some things in this film. He also does not neglect to make us think while making us laugh or sad.

In this film, he also directed the film, wrote the script, acted in the film, produced the film, was not content with these; he also composed the music of the film himself.

Yet, as technology marched on, it was only inevitable that a routine oriented toward slapstick and larger-than-life personalities would not survive a transition. Regardless of Chaplin dismissing the introduction of sound and calling it just a fad, I don't believe he didn't see the writing on the wall and the encompassing potential of this ""fad."" Hence, the triumph of this defiant silent picture elevates its status to legendary proportions.Well, it's not even silent out of limitations to begin with. From the start, the picture straight up makes fun of the talkies in the opening scene and then belittles the value of dialogue. The film still uses sound for scoring and sound effects too. And that score sure does a lot of work to enhance the scenes. The plot itself is not intricate, and almost just like in every comedy, it mostly serves to deliver Tramp to humorous set pieces.Even if you haven't seen it, chances are you've heard about the ending. It's considered one of the most perfect endings in cinema and one of the greatest scenes in Chaplin movies. I, too, had heard about it. And I genuinely thought that this reputation was there because she didn't recognize him, giving the whole thing a bittersweet touch.

",8,"One day in 1931 Charlie Chaplin met with the management of United Artists. The great comedian wanted to update his studio on the status of ""City Light"", the latest silent movie he was shooting. But Chaplin was in for a shock. The executives told him that they weren't interested in that project any longer. After ""The Jazz Singer"" became a sensation a few years earlier, all the major companies in Hollywood had began to make talking pictures instead. And United Artists certainly didn't intend to fall behind on that profitable bandwagon.In the absence of backing from his studio, Charlie Chaplin realized that he had to handle everything by himself. And he decided to do that with his custumary, profesional skill. So, Chaplin set out to write the story and the screenplay, edit the uncut film and compose its musical score. During a grueling 179-day shooting session he then produced and directed ""City Light"" by himself. A silent movie where Charlie Chaplin, as usual, starred as the Little Tramp. A man with a heart of gold.For the role of the blind flower lady, Chaplin had chosen Virginia Cherrill, a 20-year-old girl with no previous acting experience. After a few months, however, he fired her because she often came to the set late. A decision Chaplin had to change when he found out how much it would cost to re-shoot all her scenes. So, the director decided to hire Virginia Cherrill again. But now with double the salary.""City Lights"" became a major box office hit. A fact that certainly wasn't thanks to United Artists. Their management always doubted that a silent movie could still attract an audience. In the absence of their support, Chaplin therefore had to take control of the film's distribution as well. He even leased a large movie theater in New York (with accompanying staff) to showcase it. But, although ""City Lights"" is now regarded as one of Charlie Chaplin's most important works, the film didn't receive a single nomination at the 1931 Academy Awards.",23 October 2023

",10,"How many comedians can possibly claim to have found monumental, enduring success and respect in the way that Charlie Chaplin did? Why, how many famous persons, generally, can claim such success and respect? How many films have ever been made that are greater than 'City lights?' The number cannot possibly be very high. From the opening scene it's so terrifically clever and funny as to inspire hearty laughter; within but minutes it also proves capable of such heartfelt beauty as to inspire tears. Scarcely has it begun and there can be no dispute that one of the best movies ever made, or that ever will be made, was a silent movie released in 1931, a solid few years after talkies had already been introduced.What sparing non-synchronized sound the picture does employ is utterly brilliant, a stroke of genius that only ever adds to the comedy, and the music is an utter joy as it bolsters the mood at any given time. The sets are gorgeous in their detail, and the costume design, hair, and makeup could hardly be any sharper. Meanwhile, as Chaplin himself writes, directs, and produces in addition to starring, I truly don't know which element of his skill set is stronger. The story he penned is nothing if not magnificent; all the endless gags he wove into the proceedings are simply outstanding, and when the saga aims to be sweet and stirring there is precious little comparison. At the same time, Chaplin was such a tremendous performer - in his range, nuance, personality, and emotional depth, absolutely, but also in his unflagging willingness to put himself in any situation, and sacrifice his body, in the name of entertainment. Yet for the intricacy and many moving parts of the gags, and even more so for the incredible buzzing energy that this sustains at its most outrageous and at its most sincere, it might be his direction that is most admirable of all in 'City lights.' Then again, the very last moments are so entirely perfect - surely one of the most exquisite endings in all of cinema - that maybe it is, after all, the acting that stands out most. Every last facet and small moment is shaped only with utmost care and intelligence, and the result of the man's undeniably stupendous vision is plainly stellar.Whenever there might be a slight pause in one capacity or another, it is fleeting and only engineered to set up the next bit, whether that be another illustration of exemplary wit and humor or another major beat in the earnest, compelling narrative we get alongside. Just as much to the point, as one scene follows another Chaplin illustrates a shrewd mind for finding the best way to twist the next moment to serve the comedy, the underlying tale, or both. It's noteworthy that such pauses do not particularly include the intertitles, for though these are indeed used, mostly to impart pieces of dialogue, the overall approach here is definitively visual with little need for any but the most minute of exposition. And the sum total of all this, especially given the excellent stunts and effects, is a viewing experience that is wonderfully fun, satisfying, and rewarding, and that goes by smoothly and all too quickly. Of course the title's reputation is all but peerless, as is Chaplin's, and one can assume enjoying themselves here. It cannot be overstated, however, what a marvelously smart, funny film this is, and there are genuinely very few that can come close to matching the superb, flawless blend of mirth and heart. I can understand why older movies don't always appeal to all viewers, but some classics transcend any squabbles about personal preference: no matter who you are and what you generally like in cinema, 'City lights' is an essential must-see, and that's all there is to it.",31 August 2023

rw9541351,ur80693802,tt0080684," The Empire Strikes Back is the best Star Wars film and the best in the trilogy, using its darker tone and mature themes successfully - My Ultimate Review
",10,"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back takes everything that A New Hope did great and makes everything better, into the perfect Star Wars movie and sci-fi film. George Lucas hired his old teacher Irvin Kershner to direct the film and he was the right choice, the sequel to Star Wars was written by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan whilst George Lucas wrote the story the screenplay was based upon. Normally, the person would stay away and let the director do all the work, but George Lucas found himself during every part of production and shooting. Star Wars became his magnum opus after all, but having a different director and screenwriter only helped the film because of how flawless it ended up. Empire Strikes Back is darker, bigger and offers a more awarding story which builds for a satisfying conclusion of its third and final film in the Original Trilogy. Same with A New Hope, this is a Star Wars film I've watched more times than I can count, now it's the second time I've seen it on 4k blu-ray and it's such a great experience! The Dolby Vision and HDR improves the picture quality immensely.Set three years after the events of Star Wars. After the Rebels are overpowered by the Empire, Luke Skywalker begins his Jedi training with Yoda, while his friends are pursued across the galaxy by Darth Vader and bounty hunter Boba Fett.The ensemble cast includes Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Anthony Daniels, David Prowse, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew, and Frank Oz. After the sequence on the ice planet Hoth, the heroes get split up and it works heavily in the film's favor as Luke Skywalker gets to go on a quest to find the wise Jedi Master, Yoda. Mark Hamill's acting have improved immensely, having the best performance after Harrison Ford, then Carrie Fisher who's also great in the role of Leia Organa. In my opinion, Han Solo has the best character arc as we get to see how much he has changed a character, mostly because of when Lando Calrissian comes into the picture. No one can deny the chemistry between Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher, they were in a secret relationship after all, thus selling their relationship in the film. In this film we get to see the Emperor in hologram form who is also known as Darth Sidious, but regarding Darth Vader, we get to see more of him and the film even humanizes him, what once was a two-dimensional character gets an arc that'll ultimately make Vader into a three-dimensional character and also one of the most important characters in the Skywalker Saga. During their conversation, Vader and the Emperor, we get to hear the first piece of dialogue that hints of the film's big twist with Vader telling Luke that he's Luke's father. Then we have the dialogue between Yoda and Luke with him Yoda telling Kenobi he has much anger in him like his father. Then we have the vision in Dagobah when Luke fights Vader and when he destroys him, his own face appears inside the helmet, foreshadowing the twist I spoke of. This scene confused me when I was a child, also being quite scared of it, but when I grew older I noticed how brilliant a piece of storytelling it is. The duel between Luke and Vader in Cloud City is the start of the great duels to come, its well choreographed and also choreographed in the way how Luke is inexperienced and Vader is holding back as he wants him alive. It's great because of the emotional impact but also how much better it looks in comparison to the first film. Billy Dee Williams is simply terrific in the role as Lando Calrissian, being one of the reasons why the character grew to be so beloved. You see, Lando has a whole character arc in the 50-60 minutes he's in the film, thanks to the direction but especially the writing. Film critic Tim Robey wrote that much of Empire's imagery and narrative can be connected to the 1975 film Dersu Uzala, directed by Akira Kurosawa. Flash Gordon is also a big inspiration for the film, as are the whole trilogy. Along with themes like Duality and evil, the more mature themes helps the film in creating more powerful storytelling. Like A New Hope, Episode V uses the hero's journey to its advantage regarding Luke's character arc.The cinematography was done by Peter Suschitzky, there's plenty of great shots in this film, in all the locations. It's brilliantly shot and directed. The special effects which ILM provided for the film is perfect, an achievement. The special and visual effects are something you could easily write a whole paragraph or essay about, so I'll just say that it's completely mind blowing work done by the guys over at ILM. I think the pacing is excellent, same could be said about all the editing. Same with the previous film, the sound and music is perfect, I actually like the musical score more in this film than in A New Hope. John Williams' iconic Imperial March is in this film.It's quite interesting how the perception of films can change after years, Empire Strikes Back was met with mixed reviews upon its release, critics and fans were conflicted about its darker and maturer themes. Critics praised the expressive features and characterization of the puppeteered character Yoda. The film was nominated for various awards and won two Academy Awards, two Grammy Awards, and a BAFTA, among others. At the 8th Saturn Awards, the film received four awards: Best Science Fiction Film, Best Director (Kershner), Best Actor (Hamill), and Best Special Effects (Johnson and Edlund). The film also won a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. After a couple of years, The Empire Strikes Back has been critically reassessed and is now often regarded as the best film in the Star Wars series and among the greatest films ever made. It has had a significant impact on filmmaking and popular culture and is often considered an example of a sequel superior to its predecessor. The climax, in which Vader reveals he is Luke's father, is often ranked as one of the greatest plot twists in cinema.Some final words about the film, my favorite Star Wars film is Episode III - Revenge of the Sith so that has become my go to film I watch whenever I'm in the mood for Star Wars. Yet, The Empire Strikes Back is the ultimate experience, the best Star Wars film out there. I'll never get tired of watching this film, these characters and watch as the story is played out. Darker, more mature themes, and overall incredible. Like The Dark Knight, The Empire Strikes Back is the best film of the trilogy and of all movies.",4 January 2024

The movie utilizes constant parallel editing and sudden music cues that repeat and cut out of nowhere, which makes it feel radical even after several years since it was released. The movie's construction is truly wild, and it is hard to describe it with words. The film has no rhythm, just a love for abrupt recycling. Jack Nicholson walks out of the shadows four different times in the first ten minutes, and his character's performance is crude. However, that kind of messy and blunt performance is able to exist in a carefully calibrated film such as this.The movie juggles one scene with five other scenes and fifty cutaways, but it all moves forward in a logical way. Leonardo DiCaprio's character is so isolated and tormented, and his life is overtly juxtaposed against Matt Damon's character's life. This enhances DiCaprio's character's predicament, making us feel even more for him and loathe Damon even more. Thelma Schoonmaker did a great job of assembling the movie in such a way that it is intricate and freewheeling.The movie has a lot of energy and piecemeal bits to burn, which makes it seem like the film took on a life of its own and got away from the filmmakers at the finish line.

And before yesterday, 9 years ago, I had seen it on DVD with who was my beloved at the time, for whom it was a first.Why are these even worthy of mention, you might ask. I do think it is important for us to be able to enjoy a film at very different stages of our lives. When you're a kid, you'll look up to Rocky as the young man you wanna be. When you're of middle age, you'll understand better how Burt Young's character felt. And probably when we are much older, we may identify with Mikey who was lamenting about being 76, still chasing a chance, a dream.John G. Avildsen is the guy who set the standards for popularizing the most precious emotions. You just cannot neglect Karate Kid or Rocky. These are more than films. They are citadels of audiovisual culture.Watch Rocky, and then just look at a pic from some recent Sylvester Stallone movie. The difference of quality and grace is abyssmal. It just blows your mind to see that, the man who rose to fame with such a gem is today appearing in ""products"" that are literally nothing compared to Rocky.I won't say I don't understand it. Nor do I condemn Sly's current path. Maybe it's inevitable. Maybe it's normal that, after Rocky, you can never reach so high.There's so much to say about this movie.

The climax we reach by the ending, the victory of the guy who on paper actually lost the confrontation, the love and affection he has for the woman he has gained the heart of along the way...Rocky is not just a movie. It's that sports game you can watch again and again, knowing the result, just out of your desire to relive the emotions leading to it.There are several movies we can choose as ""the best ever"".

Borrowing an analogy of Alan Watts, only to apply it to this masterpiece:""Have you ever seen a misshaped wave? Or a wrong cloud? There are no such things. They come with nature exactly as they are supposed to.""To me, Rocky is to cinema what a wave or a cloud is to nature. It's perfect.

The Great Escape is an iconic war film that tells the incredible true story of a group of Allied prisoners of war during World War II. Directed by John Sturges, this 1963 classic has become a timeless masterpiece and remains one of the most beloved films in the genre.The movie follows a group of British and American soldiers who are held captive in a high-security German prison camp. Determined to regain their freedom, they plan an audacious escape attempt. Led by Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett (Richard Attenborough), known as ""Big X,"" they meticulously devise an elaborate plan to break out of the seemingly impenetrable prison walls.One of the standout aspects of The Great Escape is its ensemble cast, featuring some of Hollywood's finest actors at the time. Steve McQueen delivers a charismatic performance as Captain Virgil Hilts, famously known for his thrilling motorcycle chase scene. James Garner portrays Lieutenant Robert Hendley, adding depth and humor to the narrative. Each character brings a unique personality and skill set to contribute to their shared objective.The film excels in capturing both the camaraderie among the POWs and their relentless determination to reclaim their freedom. It beautifully balances moments of suspense with lighter comedic scenes that provide much-needed relief amidst the tense atmosphere.John Sturges' direction deserves special mention for his ability to create tension-filled sequences without resorting to excessive violence or gore commonly associated with war films. Instead, he focuses on building suspense through meticulous planning and execution while highlighting themes such as loyalty, sacrifice, and resilience.Furthermore, The Great Escape boasts impressive production design that transports viewers back in time to WWII-era Germany. From detailed recreations of the prison camp itself to authentic costumes and props, every element adds authenticity and immersion to the story.While some may argue that the film's runtime of over two and a half hours is excessive, it allows for thorough character development and an immersive storytelling experience. The pacing remains consistent throughout, keeping viewers engaged from start to finish.In conclusion, The Great Escape is a timeless war film that continues to captivate audiences with its thrilling story, memorable characters, and superb performances. It successfully manages to balance action-packed sequences with moments of heartwarming camaraderie.

Who knew!60 years later and my 5 year old granddaughter already sings along. Definitely the loudest if not the most dulcet tones to be sure. Kind of the definition of a classic. I doubt her grandchildren will be singing along with Hamilton.This and other Roger's and Hammerstein classics define what it means to be a classic musical. While easy to to dismiss as fluff, it is based on a true story set in 1938 on the eve of the Nazis taking over Austria, and has Nazis, betrayal, escapes, life and death situations, hiding behind it's musical scrim. The music and lyrics range from filler to carry the story along, to songs that became American Standards. ""Edelweiss"" is so well written many assume it is the actual national anthem of Austria. There are several story lines, both young children and their parents can watch the movie and leave the theatre having experienced completely different movies. Several scenes could be stressful for young children, in stark contrast to the movies general lighthearted theme. Each time I watch, a hidden gem reveals itself, worth a 30th or 40th viewing for sure. Note the stage musical and the movie version are not the same, the movie version reorders the original, and eliminates a couple of songs. Though not as extreme as the stage and movie versions of ""Chicago"" for example. That said I find Robert Wises version to be the superior production. Enjoy!",1 January 2024

Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone and perhaps my favourite actor Jack Nicholson.2) The plot shows intertwining scenes between good cops and bad criminal gangs lead by Nicholson as an Irish-American crime boss.The police and indeed Nicholson's underworld have moles causing chaos throughout as they try and identity each other along the way with some deadly consequences.3) Masterful direction by Scorsese who is a master of the genre with such hits as Goodfellas (1990). The film is Robert De Niro-less which is somewhat of a oddity for a Scorsese picture but the supporting cast make up for that loss.4) Now Scorsese films usually have an epic length. The Departed doesn't disappoint in that department with a 151m run time. I was prepared to watch over two sittings but become so gripped with the plot I watched in one and it flew by compared to some other films I have watched in the Scorsese cannon.5) Ray Winstone.

",10,"Sylvester Stallone wanted to make it in Hollywood, but he couldn't get cast in anything other than...stuff he'd rather forget he was ever near. So, he wrote his own screenplay, heavily influenced by Elia Kazan's On the Waterfront, and got it funded by the independent producers Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff, and they hired the largely unremarkable young filmmaker John Avildsen to direct. The result is a tender character piece that, especially when combined with its rousing score by Bill Conti, ends up a fun, touching sports film that never loses sight of what it's about: its central character.Rocky Balboa (Stallone) is semi-pro boxer with little technique but a lot of heart who wins more than he loses, but he can't get any particularly good fights since no one will manage him or really believes in him. He's alone in the world, trying to get the mousy, shy girl who works in the pet shop, Adrian (Talia Shire) to laugh at his corny jokes while working as a leg breaker for the small time loan shark Tony (Joe Spinelli). He has no real friends, the closest being Adrian's brother Paulie (Burt Young) who spends most of his time trying to convince Rocky to get him a job with Tony to get him out of his meat packing job.Essentially, the first hour of the film is a portrait of Rocky, his lonely life, and his early courtship with Adrian. It's a warm portrait of a bum, a guy who has something within him to make something of himself, but who has never applied himself quite right, as Mickey (Burgess Meredith) ends up saying, that he has wasted his potential on a little life in service of someone like Tony. He's also kind of dumb with the kinds of street smarts that at least allow him to acknowledge that he's made bad decisions in the past about who he had spent time with, as he outlines in a little rambling speech to a girl hanging out with the wrong crowd.He gets his chance, though, when the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) has spent too much time and too much money prepping for a bicentennial fight that is at the risk of cancellation because his opponent has a broken hand. With only five weeks to train, he can't get anyone ranked to commit to the fight, so he and the promoter George Jergen (Thayer David) decide on finding a local boy in Philadelphia to fight, zeroing in on Balboa for little reason more than his nickname, the Italian Stallion. He's reticent about the prospect. Rocky understands his limits and Creed's status as the best in the world, but it becomes too good of an opportunity to pass up.I think one of the keys to how this film works is the timing of certain events. The first is that Adrian and Rocky have their moment coming together, learning to open up to each other and fall in love, before Rocky gets his shot. This cements her as the one person he knows he can trust, as contrasted with Paulie who only seems to get helpful afterwards, hoping for a slice of the guaranteed $150,000 payout from the fight, or Mickey, who had told him off before the offer and comes begging to be his manager afterwards. After years of being rejected and used and insulted, Rocky has trouble trusting anyone, and he does eventually find ways to bring people in.And that's really the point of the film. It's not the literal fight with Creed, it's Rocky discovering his connections to other people who do genuinely love him, namely Adrian. It's about him discovering for himself that he's not a bum and that he could go the distance against Creed, last all fifteen rounds. It's not about winning. It's about proving that he belongs in that field, that he hasn't wasted the last six years of his life fighting to get nowhere. It's weird how a film where the hero doesn't actually win a fight can end up so affirming.I will say for a moment, that I found the direction rather pedestrian at best. I wouldn't really comment on it much normally, except that Avildsen won Best Director at the Oscars. I have no problem with Rocky winning Best Picture, I'd probably have voted for it, but I cannot imagine Avildsen deserving that Best Director award, especially up against Syndey Lumet for Network. I often at least partially attribute good performances to directors who can help mold the work of actors, so I cannot dismiss him completely here. The actors are all very good, and that's part of the package, but this really does feel like, overall, Avildsen getting a raw and very good script fall into his lap and largely just not screwing it up. I'm fine with that as a result, but it just kind of irritates me that Avildsen beat Lumet.I don't think that Avildsen's direction is a drag on the film, though. It's nothing special, but the strength is the script and performances, and they really get a lot of help from Conti's score. I have a major soft spot for Conti's music (like on Huston's Escape to Victory), and it's largely absent from the first hour, only getting an early show during the opening credits before slowly filtering in towards the buildup to the fight. Of course, the fight itself isn't the point, it's Rocky proving himself, and that's the ultimately victory. That it becomes so satisfying is really wonderful.Just, please, don't make any sequels, Sly. Rocky doesn't need it.",3 November 2023

Directed by Irvin Kershner and released in 1980, the film is the second installment in the original Star Wars trilogy, and it continues to be celebrated as a benchmark in both science fiction and cinematic history.Cinematography, the visual language of film, is a realm where ""The Empire Strikes Back"" shines with unparalleled brilliance. Cinematographer Peter Suschitzky, under the direction of Kershner, crafts a visual feast that immerses the audience in a galaxy far, far away. The film opens with the iconic shot of the Rebel Alliance's snowspeeders navigating the icy terrain of the planet Hoth, setting the stage for a visual spectacle that unfolds throughout the narrative.The film's use of practical effects and pioneering model work, a hallmark of the original trilogy, adds a layer of authenticity that CGI-laden contemporary films often struggle to replicate. The Battle of Hoth, with its towering AT-AT walkers and sweeping aerial maneuvers, remains a testament to the artistry of practical effects in creating a tangible and immersive experience for the audience. The dedication to practicality in filmmaking showcased in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" adds a timeless quality to its visual appeal, allowing it to withstand the test of time.John Williams' iconic score further elevates the film's cinematographic impact. The haunting Imperial March, introduced in this installment, has become synonymous with the dark and imposing presence of the Galactic Empire.

The decision to explore the vulnerabilities of the protagonists, particularly Luke Skywalker, adds a layer of emotional depth rarely seen in blockbuster franchises.The character development in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is masterfully nuanced. The relationship between Han Solo and Princess Leia evolves organically, shifting from banter and tension to a genuine and profound connection. The introduction of Yoda, the wise and enigmatic Jedi Master, serves as a pivotal moment in Luke Skywalker's journey, providing both spiritual guidance and unveiling the profound intricacies of the Force.The film's exploration of the darker side of the Force and the revelation of Darth Vader's true identity are narrative masterstrokes that subvert expectations and propel the story into uncharted territory. The iconic revelation, ""I am your father,"" delivered by Vader, remains one of the most memorable and shocking moments in cinematic history. It is a testament to the narrative boldness of ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" setting a precedent for the unpredictability that would characterize the Star Wars saga.In conclusion, ""Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back"" is a cinematic triumph that seamlessly blends groundbreaking cinematography with a narrative that transcends the boundaries of its genre. Its visual spectacle, achieved through practical effects and masterful cinematography, remains a benchmark in the history of filmmaking.

In contrast to their exploits in the last one, here our heroes are running and just trying to survive, at the end they just about managed it, and this feels like the greatest victory possible. Luke doesn't jump into a turret and start blasting tie fighter like the first film, at several points he's metaphorically and literally hanging on for dear life. The conflict is not just between the Vader and our heroes, but also internal conflict as well as conflict between our heroes.The role of Darth Vader is really beefed up in this one, when he last saw him he was in a small vulnerable tie fighter and was lucky to survive the destruction of the death star.

",7,"Rocky's rocky road to glory, both on and off the screen, makes for an impressive modern-day fairy tale. The tale of Sylvester Stallone winning an Academy Award for Best Picture with his first-ever screenplay is legendary. We all rooted for the underdog who overcame his troubled past to find his self-worth. But was the boxing ring the right stage for this pyrrhic victory?Stallone's script is simplicity itself, but credit must also go to director John Avildsen, who brought a cinema verité style to Rocky, making it feel like a gripping docudrama.In the early drafts, Rocky was a darker, less likable character, but Stallone wisely softened him. Despite moonlighting as a loan shark collector, Rocky refused to physically harm his deadbeat clients, revealing his heart of gold.Rocky's inner demons stem from doubts about his potential as a boxer. Burgess Meredith as Mickey, a former boxer turned trainer, berates Rocky for not working hard enough. Rocky's character and the audience are touched when Mickey gives his locker away, symbolizing his disappointment.Stallone's plotting shines when he cleverly shows how Rocky gets his shot at the heavyweight title. After the top contender is injured, champion Apollo Creed, excellently played by Carl Weathers, decides to give an underdog a chance for a publicity stunt. Rocky, initially reluctant, must face his doubts and fears.The evolving relationship between Rocky and Mickey adds depth to the story. Mickey, now willing to manage Rocky, is rejected at first, but their heartwarming reconciliation is a defining moment, cleverly shot at a distance to emphasize their embrace.While Rocky's boxing journey is thrilling, the film is more a love story. Talia Shire's understated performance as Adrian, a pet store employee initially portrayed as a spinster, adds a sensitive touch. The growing romance is tenderly handled, and Shire's best scene is the powerful confrontation with her brother Paulie, played by the late Burt Young, who also happens to be Rocky's best friend.Paulie represents the darker side of Rocky's insecurities, unable to control his anger at his own lot in life. His overbearing presence and strange emotional attachments to his sister hint at a more complicated relationship with possible incestuous feelings toward her.In its time, the climactic showdown was an adrenaline rush. Watching Creed and Rocky face off in the heavyweight championship was a visceral experience. Rocky's loss but indomitable spirit ""going the distance"" proved iconic.Today, the film may seem dated. Boxing has lost some of its luster, with no larger-than-life figures gracing the sport as in years past. More critically, the idea of redemption and triumph through the brutality of boxing has lost some of its shine, especially when we look at the post-career health of many fighters. Muhammad Ali's tragic battle with neurological damage serves as a sobering example.Despite these shifts, all the performances in Rocky hold up remarkably well, especially Stallone's, who never quite equaled this feat in his long career. As a modern-day fairy tale, Rocky remains an impressive cinematic achievement, even if the boxing metaphor feels a bit punch-drunk nowadays.",29 October 2023

He has a love/hate relationship with his friend Paulie (Burt Young), loves Paulie's sister Adrian (Talia Shire), and enforces payments to loan shark Gazzo (Joe Spinell). Heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) is looking for a title fight to celebrate the nation's bicentennial, but his opponent drops out. He and promoter Jergens (Thayer David) cook up a plan- give any mook a shot at the champ, in the name of the American way. Balboa is chosen, and Creed goes about the financial business of being a champ, not taking Rocky seriously. Rocky enlists the help of Mickey (Burgess Meredith), a gym owner who saw Rocky's potential many years before, but the two never acted on it. As the fight draws near, Rocky's relationship with Paulie deteriorates as his love for Adrian takes center stage.I had not seen the original ""Rocky"" in decades. I highly recommend the crisp widescreen DVD transfer, which puts all the videotape releases to shame. I literally forgot what a dark and grim film this is. Rocky's Philadelphia neighborhood is a bit run down, his apartment is a pit, and director John G. Avildsen captures it all perfectly, which is strange considering the almost comic book style of the sequels. Stallone does a fine scripting job. While Rocky's relationship with Adrian takes a while, and the volatile Paulie is never explored too much, Stallone seems to know what the film audience wants. I always thought the fight at the end of the film was longer, but it barely makes ten or fifteen minutes. Weathers' Apollo is not as big a jerk as I remember, until he gets into the ring and must put on his show. Adrian could not be mousier, even with Mickey ears and a tail, but her transformation is believable without being jarring. Young and Meredith also turn in fine performances, not yet the one dimensional characters the sequels would turn them in to. ""Rocky"" is not a excellent film.

Other characters were composites, but the main part of the story is close to the real events, and they used a real survivor of the camp as a technical consultant.

He did say in an interview that prisoners were not as rude to heavily armed guards as in the movie - I think I would be polite to a guy with a Schmeiser submachine gun too!

Rocky, as I found, is not the stereotypical macho figure you might think: even though he is a boxer with the classic ''tough guy"" look, he often shows his most sensitive and fragile sides, which makes him a role model in many ways. I really liked the way they developed his love story with Adriana, because this side storyline was made almost as important as the main one, creating some balance and avoiding making it an action movie.Even though the movie came out in 1976 it is still perfectly enjoyable and the values it conveys are still relevant to our society nowadays, which to me makes it a timeless classic.",5 October 2023

Probably the greatest ensemble cast of Hollywood and Commonwealth acting talent ever put to film (or good use anyway). Be it the Commonwealth/British acting talent of the likes of Richard Attenborough or Hollywood heavyweights such as Steve McQueen and James Garner. Add the likes of Donald Pleasance, Charles Bronson and others. The list is endless. Their characters all have a vital role in the operation, hence their nicknames in the film such as The Tunnel King or The Scrounger.....2. Music. A rousing score by Elmer Bernstein that is still revered to this day.3. Length. This film is long, approximately 172 minutes. Just below epic length. It allows for all the facets of the escape operation to be played out in all their glory. Every dollar/pound or whatever is on the screen.4. Historical accuracy. Okay some of the more pedantic reviews may sniff about the historical accuracy but the main events happened. There is some artistic licence added to the screenplay no doubt but in what Hollywood production isn't there?5, The poster doesn't have little boxes of the stars faces that is so often the case in films with multiple star attractions but is ultimately a let down! Good marketing in my opinion.If I have any complaints with the film (albeit minor) it is the last act featuring the escape aftermath.

Yep, Star Wars first followed by The Empire Strikes back.As a small 10 year old-ish, I still to this day, remember how blown away I was seeing the huge Star destroyer take up my whole vision, seeing Vader for the first time and then when we got to meet Han and Chewy and the most iconic ship of all, The MILLENNIUM FALCON.Fast forward to the end of the film, seeing the Death Star blow up and my tiny, Juvenile mind blown to pieces, I remember standing up, ready to leave and my Dad saying we were going to wait for a bit, grabbed more popcorn and drink, sat waiting, mind reeling and then the movie lights dimmed again.Being young and confused, fan fare on the screen, I was thinking ""Great, we're watching it again""

The musical ""West Side Story"" stands out as an exception, being the first to portray the Latino community in New York and delve into their political issues.""The Sound of Music"" has been subject to criticism for its portrayal of politics. The film's protagonist, Captain von Trapp, resists Nazism, but his opposition is not rooted in its antisemitism, militarism, or authoritarianism.

",8,"When it comes to timeless classics, few films have left as indelible a mark on the world of cinema as ""The Sound of Music."" Released in 1965, this musical masterpiece directed by Robert Wise and starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer has enchanted generations with its captivating story, memorable songs, and stunning Austrian landscapes. However, even the most beloved classics can be subject to scrutiny, and in this review, we will explore the notion that ""The Sound of Music"" could potentially be better, examining its strengths, weaknesses, and the possibilities for revitalizing this cherished cinematic gem.Set against the backdrop of the beautiful Austrian Alps, ""The Sound of Music"" tells the heartwarming tale of Maria (Julie Andrews), a spirited young nun who is sent to be the governess for the seven von Trapp children, widowed Captain Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer)'s offspring. The film is a captivating blend of romance, music, and drama, as Maria's free-spirited nature clashes with the Captain's stern demeanor, while they both grapple with their growing affection for one another amidst the looming threat of the Nazi regime.One of the film's undoubted strengths is its memorable music, composed by Richard Rodgers with lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II. From the iconic opening number, ""The Sound of Music,"" to the touching ""Edelweiss"" and the lively ""Do-Re-Mi,"" the soundtrack is a symphony of melodies that have become a part of our cultural fabric. Julie Andrews' soaring soprano voice and the children's harmonious choruses create moments of sheer auditory bliss that are hard to rival. The musical numbers elevate the film and provide it with a timeless quality that continues to draw audiences to this day.The cast of ""The Sound of Music"" is another asset that has stood the test of time. Julie Andrews is luminous as Maria, exuding warmth and charisma, while Christopher Plummer brings depth and vulnerability to the stoic Captain von Trapp. The chemistry between the two leads is palpable, and their love story remains one of cinema's most enduring romances. The von Trapp children, played by a talented ensemble of young actors, add charm and innocence to the narrative, making their journey from discipline to joy all the more endearing.The film's breathtaking cinematography also deserves acclaim. Robert Wise and his team expertly capture the stunning Austrian landscapes, with sweeping shots of lush green hills, crystal-clear lakes, and majestic mountains. The visuals serve as a visual symphony that complements the musical one, immersing the audience in the story's picturesque world. The contrast between the natural beauty of the surroundings and the encroaching threat of Nazi occupation heightens the film's tension and emotional impact.However, despite its many strengths, ""The Sound of Music"" is not without its flaws, and it is these areas that warrant a critical reevaluation.First and foremost, the film's pacing can be a bit uneven. While the musical numbers are undoubtedly the film's highlights, the transitions between these musical sequences and the dramatic moments can feel abrupt and disjointed. The film's nearly three-hour runtime occasionally drags, and some scenes could benefit from tighter editing to maintain a more consistent flow.Another aspect that merits reconsideration is the treatment of certain characters. The portrayal of the von Trapp family's housekeeper, Frau Schmidt, and the nuns at the abbey where Maria resides can be seen as somewhat one-dimensional and stereotypical. These characters, while important to the story, are not given the same depth and development as the main characters, leaving them feeling like caricatures rather than fully realized individuals.Furthermore, the film's depiction of the Nazi threat, while undoubtedly a central element of the story, may come across as somewhat sanitized to modern audiences. Given the gravity of the historical context, ""The Sound of Music"" could have delved deeper into the political and moral complexities of the era. While the film does not shy away from the looming danger, a more nuanced exploration of the characters' choices and dilemmas in the face of Nazism could have added depth to the narrative.In addition, some viewers may find fault with the film's idealized portrayal of the von Trapp family's escape from the Nazis. The daring flight over the mountains is undoubtedly a gripping climax, but it also carries a sense of adventure that borders on the fantastical. A more realistic portrayal of the dangers and challenges faced by those fleeing the Nazi regime could have made the story even more impactful.So, how could ""The Sound of Music"" be improved? One approach could involve reimagining the film as a limited series, allowing for a more expansive exploration of its characters and historical context. This format would provide the opportunity to delve deeper into the backgrounds and motivations of characters like Captain von Trapp and Maria, as well as to address the broader political landscape of Austria in the late 1930s.A longer format would also allow for a more gradual development of the romance between Maria and the Captain, giving their relationship a more authentic and nuanced feel. It could also provide the space to explore the emotional impact of their choices on the von Trapp children and the other characters in the story.In terms of pacing, a series format would alleviate the need to compress the narrative into a three-hour film, allowing for a more natural progression of the story and character arcs. It would also provide an opportunity to delve into the lives and experiences of characters like Frau Schmidt and the nuns, giving them the depth and dimension they deserve.In conclusion, ""The Sound of Music"" is undeniably a cinematic classic that has earned its place in the hearts of audiences worldwide. Its timeless music, enchanting performances, and stunning visuals continue to captivate new generations. However, a critical reevaluation reveals areas where the film could be improved, particularly in terms of pacing, character development, and historical context.One possible approach to revitalizing this beloved classic is to reimagine it as a limited series, allowing for a more in-depth exploration of its characters and historical backdrop. While ""The Sound of Music"" may never be perfect in the eyes of every viewer, it remains a testament to the enduring power of storytelling and the magic of cinema.",7 October 2023

I remember embedding in my mind a promise for years that I would come to revisit the film with a developed understanding and perception of the modern world to further appreciate the nuances and deep-rooted subjects and motifs being conveyed. When the day came to me to rewatch the film as an adult, I was completely mesmerized by how completely different I had perceived its themes when I was a child. The years added to my living and experiencing the society have made such a difference in terms of how I was able to comprehend the complexities and layers of its depiction of our world.

",9,"With his 2004 movie ""Der Untergang"" (aka ""Downfall""), director Oliver Hirschbiegel delivered quite an amazing movie. This is such a hard-hitting movie and one that most definitely deserves to be seen, regardless of you having an interest in World War II or not. Why? Well, because it is a powerful story and one that proves that history must never be forgotten.Writer Bernd Eichinger put together a powerful and memorable script and story, based on the books by Joachim Fest, Traudl Junge and Melissa Müller. The storyline told in ""Der Untergang"" is one that will stick with you for a long time.I am really amazed with the storytelling in ""Der Untergang"", because director Oliver Hirschbiegel takes the audience along on a very emotional journey throughout the 156 minutes that the movie runs for. You might think that 156 minutes is a long runtime, but it actually is not, because the story is so nicely told, so interesting and so encompassing that you just get swept up and carried along the narrative as it unfolds and shows the last days of the regime of Adolf Hitler and the end of his Third Reich.Leading actor Bruno Ganz, playing Adolf Hitler, puts on such an amazing performance in this movie that it is hard not to be impressed. Bruno Ganz's performance in ""Der Untergang"" is so powerful that his performance alone makes the movie well-worth watching. In fact, the entire cast ensemble in the movie put on great performances individually, and that really added so much to the overall presentation of the movie.""Der Untergang"" is a movie that leaves quite an impression upon the viewer.And the fact that everything is kept in German, and some Russian language as well, makes it all the more believable and authentic. If this movie was dubbed, it would be an affront to writer Bernd Eichinger and director Oliver Hirschbiegel.The costume and props departments worked their magic to make ""Der Untergang"" look and feel like a proper World War II movie, which definitely was a crucial factor for the overall impact of the movie. It looks and feels the way it is supposed to, and that kind of authenticism really makes all the difference.If you haven't already seen ""Der Untergang"", then you most certainly should do so, should you get the chance. This is a must-watch movie.My rating of ""Der Untergang"" lands on a nine out of ten stars.",27 December 2023

I might even venture to describe it as horrible, but that is what makes this film so powerful. The nuance that plays out between all of those attributes makes it something special.On top of that, the acting in this movie is incredible. Everybody plays their part incredibly well with an very diverse and dynamic character line up/cast (in terms of characteristics).

It's unbelievable to think about it in those terms.Although ""Downfall"" is not perfect, it's still an excellent movie from the perspective of a movie enthusiast. Some people might argue that it's a problem that the movie is not in English, but it's actually a good thing because it adds to the movie's authenticity.The movie is well-paced brilliantly shot, and the cinematography is outstanding.

It's a shame he didn't win an Academy Award for his performance.If you're not a fan of subtitles, it might be a problem to watch this movie.

",9,"""The most evil man in history drags everyone down with him..."" That could have been the subtitle to this tremendous film. But that would be letting Adolf Hitler off lightly.Make no mistake - ""Downfall"" is not a film that could get made in Hollywood. They wouldn't get it - they don't have the cultural history that Europe has. They haven't had a single man stand astride the continent and lay waste to it. And not just physically destroy - but morally destroy too. That's what Downfall is about - the utter disintegration and ruination of everything that might be regarded as ""human"".No - only Germans could make this film. Only Germans could truly grasp, portray and confront what Hitler was, and what the Nazis were - and show it to themselves and the world.Downfall is made very much in the German film-making tradition. The story is told through the eyes of Traudl Junge - Hitler's young newly recruited secretary. An incredible, almost unbelievable story, but actually true.The German tradition is seen in the way the story is constructed around ""family"" - in this instance Hitler's entourage. Indeed - Hitler treats his young civilian staff, including Junge as if they are his family - the family he doesn't have. Part of the power of Downfall is its very personal nature. We are close in to the centre of it all - like we are really there.We are confronted with complete madness. Insanity. Mayhem. Wanton and needless death. Stupidity. Madness. But in Downfall we find ourselves as willing observers of it - observing it as if it is somehow ""normal"".We see the pointless appalling destruction of whole families. It's shocking and deeply moving at the same time. Because of the graphic filming it's all hugely impactful.Bruno Ganz is (was) a legend in German-speaking cinema before he came to this role (see also my review here of Wim Wender's Wings of Desire). But this portrayal here of the deranged tyrant Hitler is quite simply magnificent.Sets, filming, script - all are strong with excellent supporting acting.Why not a 10/10 then? Well - Downfall is almost too dense - too powerful - almost beyond the edge of anything. Indeed - Berlin in April 1945 WAS beyond the edge of everything morally, just as all of Germany had been under the years of Nazi rule. Whilst there can be, and should be no redeeming feature - perhaps that's the problem I have. Traudl Junge worked closely with the most evil person in history. It's just beyond the edge of possible to imagine what that was like - even though I have seen it through her eyes.It's still a tremendous film. An amazing cinema experience.",2 November 2023

",9,"The 2013 ""Rush"" from director Ron Howard is a high-quality and soulful film that demonstrates the exciting story, adrenaline of Formula 1 racing and human drama. This picture was even nominated in the Best Film category at the Golden Globe Awards, but lost to the film 12 Years a Slave. A serious opponent who could not be bypassed. Nevertheless, Howard's project became a memorable work in the careers of all involved.In the ""Rush"", the excellent acting and successful directorial vision create a rich and exciting world. Chris Hemsworth as James Hunt and Daniel Bruhl as Niki Lauda go beyond the simple embodiment of the characters, and their characters come to life. Charismatic characters allow the viewer to feel the inner fire of rivalry and passion for victory.Hemsworth, known for his appearance and charm, convincingly conveys the passion and audacity of his character, creating an image of an intriguing and often uncomfortable hero for others. Involuntarily, a comparison with the famous hero Thor, whom Hemsworth has been playing for many years, suggests itself. Here, under the appearance of Thor, there is a completely different character, into which the actor has so successfully reincarnated. Chris's excellent performance, a worthy role that will forever remain in his career as one of the strongest.Daniel Bruhl as Niki Lauda perfectly conveys the character of this legendary racer. His acting work is characterized by precision and depth, revealing not only Lauda's professional qualities, but also his inner world, including difficult moments in his personal life.The script of the film is masterfully written, paying attention not only to racing and high speed, but also to the deep human relationships underlying the story. This balance between competition and friendship creates a touching and exciting aspect that manages to be conveyed in every frame.Technically, the painting was created with great care. Decent editing and soundtrack give the film a special status, taking it to a new level, especially in the racing scenes, where the viewer almost physically feels the speed and adrenaline.Especially impressive is the attention to detail in the visual design of the film, recreating the style of the 1970s. Costumes, cars, scenery - everything embodies the atmosphere of that era and gives the film a unique character. And the color correction is deliberately specially selected in such a way that the viewer feels like he is watching a 1970s movie.But, of course, one of the main achievements of the ""Rush"" is the exciting racing scenes. They not only immerse the viewer into the world known even to people who are not interested in Formula 1, but also convey the extreme sensations and risks associated with this sport.Ron Howard's compositional work is an art that can pull the viewer into the dynamic world of race tracks and at the same time remain true to the deep human aspects of the story. The director's vision of the director deserves the highest praise. He expertly handles Peter Morgan's script, immersing the viewer in the intriguing world of Formula 1 and at the same time paying attention to human relationships. Howard emphasizes emotional moments and moves from exciting racing scenes to deep reflections of the characters with ease, as if playfully, not allowing the viewer to understand where the transition from action to drama and back happens.The director not only gives the viewer the opportunity to feel the adrenaline of racing, but also delves into the psychology and motivation of the characters. He carefully balanced the dynamic racing moments with the touching and meaningful scenes between Hunt and Lauda, creating a harmonious piece.The painting is remembered for another important aspect - the work of Hans Zimmer. It has long been no secret to me that the projects to which the composer puts his hand are literally doomed to success. I love Zimmer's music, and it's very good here. The musical work in the film adds an additional layer of emotional saturation and enhances the visual range.Hans Zimmer, known for his unique style and sense of rhythm, created a soundtrack that perfectly matches the dynamics of the racing scenes and at the same time skillfully emphasizes the internal conflicts of the characters. His compositions in the film seem to become a separate character who actively interacts with the plot and conveys subtle interweaving of emotions. The picture is not limited only to visual and acting aspects, but also includes the musical magic of Hans Zimmer.""Rush"" is not just an ordinary film about professionals driving, of which there are probably a dozen. This is a great real story about friendship, passion, overcoming oneself and difficulties. Director Ron Howard has created a work that can delight and inspire, even those who are not fans of the world of racing. The painting is still remembered with interest, even a decade after viewing. This is an exciting journey that leaves an indelible impression and causes deep admiration for the work of the entire team, and, most importantly, opens up the real stories of Niki Lauda and James Hunt for the average viewer.9 out of 10.",26 December 2023

",10,"Every time I write about a musical (which is not often) I say this: I really don't care about them and neither do a bunch of other film fans. However, this movie is arguably the most famous one ever made so I am going to make an exception here. The Wizard of Oz was originally a kid's book from 1900, but is today mostly remembered as this beyond legendary movie which has its monumental reputation for a number of reasons. It utilized Technicolor at a time when few other films did in order to take full advantage of the grandiose fantasy setting, it had original and memorable characters, morals, and an unforgettable adventure. I don't think there's any person on Earth who hasn't seen this at least once, so explaining the plot might seem like an exercise in futility, but it's one of the greatest stories ever told. The movie begins with a rural teenage girl named Dorothy (Judy Garland) living on a farm in Kansas with her Aunt and Uncle. Dorothy's terrier, Toto, bites a rich woman named Almira, which leads to the latter wanting the dog to be put down. Toto is confiscated by Almira, but makes it back to Dorothy, and they run off together to escape Almira's wrath. Dorothy intends on running away, but meets a fraudulent fortune teller who tells Dorothy her aunt is sick and she must go home to her right away. She arrives back home just as a big tornado is about to demolish her house. She takes shelter in the house and is knocked out by violent winds as the tornado transports the house to what seems like another dimension. Dorothy wakes up in what is called Munchkinland which is part of the land of Oz. Tiny people (known as munchkins) are happy Dorothy's house is here as it just so happened to land on an evil witch named the Wicked Witch of the East, killing her. The witch's sibling, the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton), appears out of thin air in order to take back a pair of shiny ruby slippers which belonged to her sister. However, a benevolent witch named Glinda uses her magic to make Dorothy wear them. The Wicked Witch can't use her powers in a happy land like Munchkinland, so she is forced to leave, but tells Dorothy next time she won't be so lucky. Glinda instructs Dorothy to follow what is known as the Yellow Brick Road which leads into Emerald City, home to the Wizard of Oz and the person who will know how she can get back home. On the way there, Dorothy meets other outlandish characters, namely a Scarecrow, a metal man known as Tin Man, and a humanoid lion called The Cowardly Lion (Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and Bert Lahr respectively). As each one meets Dorothy, they agree to accompany her on her journey, as each of them wants to ask the Wizard for something they believe is important to them. The Tin Man wants a heart so he can feel human emotions, the Lion wants courage so he can stop being afraid, and the Scarecrow wants a brain. Upon reaching Emerald City, Dorothy is let in, but only after mentioning Glinda sent them. They meet with the Wizard, who says who will grant their wishes, but only if they're able to get the Wicked Witch's broomstick. Dorothy and her friends set out to infiltrate the Witch's secret fortress, but the Witch orders flying monkey servants she owns to capture Dorothy and Toto. The Witch locks Dorothy in a room of the castle and says if she doesn't give up the slippers, she will kill her dog. Toto manages to run off and alert Tin Man, The Lion and Scarecrow to Dorothy's trouble. The three disguise themselves as the Witch's soldiers and get into the castle. Tin Man uses his axe to break down the door Dorothy is locked behind, and they attempt to escape. They don't get very far before the huge swarms of soldiers surround them. The Wicked Witch sets her broom on fire and torches Scarecrow with it, leading Dorothy to extinguish him with a bucket of water. Some of the water gets onto the witch, who proceeds to melt and die. Dorothy says she didn't mean to kill her, but the Witch's own soldiers are glad she is finished and want Dorothy to take the broom to the Wizard. Arriving back in Oz's chamber, Dorothy presents him with the broom, but the Wizard doesn't uphold his end of the deal. He says to come back tomorrow. Toto pulls back a curtain in the corner of the chamber, revealing the Wizard to be nothing more than an ordinary guy operating a machine that projects a big, transparent image of his face. Angry at first for being lied to, Dorothy confronts the Wizard, but he grants the wishes of Tin Man, The Lion, and Scarecrow by giving them things that represent the traits they always wanted. The Lion gets a medal symbolizing his bravery, Tin Man gets a heart with a clock inside it, and Scarecrow is given a PhD. The Wizard then offers to fly Dorothy back to Kansas in a hot air balloon, but right before setting off, Toto jumps from the basket and Dorothy must run after him. She is left behind. Now depressed that she'll never get back home, Dorothy sees an orb of light approaching, which contains Glinda. The good witch says Dorothy had the ability to return to Kansas the whole time, but had to find that out for herself. All she has to do is tap her heels together with her eyes closed and say ""there's no place like home."" After saying bye to her friends, she does this and wakes up in her bed, her Aunt and Uncle standing nearby. The farm hands who work for her Aunt look exactly like her three friends from Oz, but they are convinced it was just a dream. This entire film from start to end is just pure magic. I might be wrong, but I really think it is the overall the most famous movie ever. Everything about it is basically perfect, and there's many reasons why it has stood the test of time for almost a century. The landscapes of Oz are just wondrous, and everything is so colorful it looks like you can reach out and touch it. Garland's portrayal of Dorothy is a masterpiece. While this film may basically define the word classic and is what most people think of when they imagine the golden age of movies, it would be nothing without her contributions. She doesn't pretend to be a hero on her quest, and only wants to see her family again. She doesn't even want revenge on the witch trying to sabotage her at every turn. She is in a big hurry to run away in the beginning for the safety of her dog, but by the end, she realizes home is the place where they're most safe. Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch is great. She's menacing, and even though most people think of this as a kid's film, she is genuinely so good and creepy in her role that you can't take your eyes off her. She and the other characters have no doubt left permanent impressions on film fans for decades, and will continue to do so. As long as movies are a thing, I'm very confident that The Wizard of Oz will keep on being watched, praised and written about for generations. It is hard for me to say if this or Gone With the Wind is the all time iconic American movie, but it's so hard to choose between two masterpieces.",1 January 2024

The performances, songs and dance numbers are extremely zany, catchy and camp but it blends in well with the ridiculousness of the film itself.

The 4K image is crystal clear and the downside to that is certain special effects are extremely noticable and not always effectuve - such as the visible trap door when the Wicked Witch appears/disappears in the Munckim City or when the Wicked Witch flies on her broom around the castle and you can tell it's a small toy on a string or wire. Even though I did laugh at these on my recent watch through, i also appreciated the skill and effort it took to achieve such special effects in 1939 - and it would of looked perfectly realistic on CRT TV, VHS and DVD...Final Verdict:
This movie is a classic and a much loved family favourite for many generations. The songs are catchy, the story timeless and the performances are memorable. In 4K the image is so clear and vibrant you'd think the film was made this century!",28 December 2023

",0,"The film is strange, well made but isn't free from flaws also. It's a film of a world where darkness reigns at max, like hitman killing people, police officers involving drugs, common people lives involving drugs and dysfunctional lifestyles, uneducated themes etc. It's all dark but the camera is used with illuminating light, which makes it unappealing mostly. Leon is about a hitman who comes in contact with an 12 year old girl and develops complex relationship. This relationship changes him, changes for the better actually. He gradually takes the taste of life, which is actually true between father and daughter. But leon is not her father, a kinda father figure but not father. It seem optimistic highly but will make you feel unreal also. He becomes attached with her and feels the impact of sentiments. He becomes human but this transformation has a reason behind which finally takes the ultimate toll on his life. That reason is the saga of revenge fof mathilda's family.The technical aspects are well executed like the script which progresses logically and good work has been done to bring out the characters to screen. But the BGM seems to be of issue here, it is used heavily on the first half. The sexualized part of 12 year old girl with leon made it very strange, very confused now to recommend this film. I understood it, it means mathilda's upbringing was done in a dysfunctional family. The characters may be real individually but as as an aggregate it is unbelievable. The whole plot involves killings and training to be a killer but does it all appeal in real life ? It may have in someway but the lighting should be used in a dark fashion to intensify that reality. Tony felt like the true hero of the film, who didn't exploit or made mathilda engage in any other work, rather he used leon's money to send her back to school. That's real hero in real world. But the film is not about Tony, it's about Leon. The set of the film with BGM seems like an arab world suddenly and uniquely appearing in USA.A film well made technically but will be called a film nevertheless, not a real experience. I abstain from rating it due to its dark content presented in a brilliant way to be accepted by society. But that doesn't appeal universally for all. Is this film made only for the French ? Are French like that ? A strange movie in all.",1 January 2024

No police investigation, no questions about where daughter is? No one else in the apartment wonders where the girl has gone. I don't think Portman is very good in this either, though she's far too young to be playing the role too. She's much better in Beautiful Girls (1996). The film is really poor too in that there's not really a plot. This is in many ways quite a sick film about a hitman who uses a child as a tool to help him carry out his missions. One the worst moments involves the hitman storming a police station to rescue his friend without getting a scratch. The film keeps insisting the hitman is Italian when he's clearly French. There's also no tension between the two sides as they have almost no screen time together.I will say the editing, music and cinematography is really good but the story is not a good one.",24 December 2023

Maara's friends get short but effective roles as well, as does Mohan Babu as Naidu. Director Sudha also deserves praise for using everyday language to explain a few technical terms. The intensity of proceedings does soften in the second half, when somehow, things seem to fall too quickly in place, with help pouring in from unexpected quarters for the protagonist.

Mayer wanted MGM to make a fantasy film in the style of Walt Disney's hugely successful ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" from the previous year. After some thought, producer Mervyn LeRoy suggested that L. Frank Baum's book ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" could be adapted into a movie. After all, Baum's work was considered an American classic.At that time most films were made in black and white. Working in color meant you had to use a whole new type of camera - and they were big and cumbersome. In addition, MGM was forced to accept a so-called ""Technicolor consultant"" from the camera manufacturer. A man who stood next to the cinematographer and told him how to light every scene. Mayer didn't care, though. He wanted to compete with Disney's pioneering feature. And ""Snow White"" was in color.""The Wizard of Oz"" was made exclusively at the MGM Studios in Culver City. But it was a messy production. The first director was fired after 12 days. Victor Fleming took over, but he was moved to ""Gone with the Wind"". So, it was up to King Vidor to finish the film. And there were cast changes, too. The Tin Man had an allergic reaction to the silvery makeup and had to be replaced. The Wicked Witch was severely burned when she went up in a puff of smoke. Even Toto (the dog) was out of commission for a week after being stepped on by a crew member.The film had its world premiere at Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood. Judy Garland then went on an East Coast publicity tour, which included the New York opening of ""Oz"". But it didn't help. ""The Wizard of Oz"" had been so expensive to produce that MGM made a net loss of millions. The studio didn't get their money back until 1949, when the movie had its re-release worldwide. The following year, MGM sold the rights to TV, where the film has been shown ever since.",21 November 2023

This wasn't exactly a bad movie, it's just that the characters were not very likable and there wasn't enough action. A lot of parts in this film didn't make sense.

Sure, there were a few scenes where a hero might give up weapons to take on a villian one-on-one physically, but that's still excusable with the kind of direction & acting in this movie. The way they have depicted an army operation in this movie, tactical & precise with advanced combat weapons is quite a rarity in Indian movies. Yet, I am not a big fan of the story around and the depiction of the bird-like Drone which supposedly could operate for hours and made by an intern at DRDO. Not so much realistic as the rest of the movie was.No unwarranted romance, no over-the-top action both of which something Bollywood should try more of.

",6,"First, let's talk about the positives. I really like the way the movie opens. The gentleness of the everyday scenes along with the gentle music, it reminds me of low-budget, high-quality independent films. I'm not a fan of sports movies, especially MMA. But to be honest, the dialogue scenes for psychological development in the movie are great. And the realism in the martial arts fight scenes, WOW! My favorite were the scenes involving Paddy Conlon, very emotional. And happy ending anyway.However, the character of Tommy leaves some regret. I'm not talking about Tom Hardy's acting, but the portrayal of this character, he's developed very well, but in the end he becomes a younger brother who gets beaten to a pulp by his older brother, and doesn't show anything else. How the fighters clashed with each other and in the end, two of them made it to the finals. Isn't it too obvious? All developments related to MMA matches do not reveal any surprising or shocking details. Except for the match between Tommy and Mad Dog, I liked that one. And the ending didn't bring as much emotion as I expected. His brother Brendan has a lot of interesting scenes, but I don't find it as special as the scenes where Tommy appears, perhaps because of the actor's face? Or acting ability? Idk. The film takes on the theme of family, and this is quite close to many people. But there are characters who don't show much, like Tess for example. Tommy at the beginning of the movie has a messy diet and is addicted to pills and alcohol, but he looks so healthy. This is a bit absurd. And I was really hoping for scenes showing Paddy's actual training with Tommy, but instead, there were only quick flashes. The story of Ahab and the book Moby Dick also do not show value to those who do not know about the book. Finally, Paddy, I like this character, but in the end, he did nothing, he did not show anything and receive forgiveness from his two sons. Thus, it can be considered that the movie failed to resolve the topic of family.",15 November 2023

The twist and revelation of Christian Bale's character was unexpected and teased unknowingly throughout the film and while the 'twin' reveal may be a little cliche I think it was done amazingly and really showed how something so simple can torment. Meanwhile, Hugh Jackman's twist was, as I mentioned earlier, drifting into the supernatural and, funnily enough, I had a prediction that was almost exact to the twist but thought it unbelievable and a poor plot so it was discarded.Overall, 'The Prestige' is definitely worth watching but It does leave you feeling a little unsatisfied afterwards.The acting is amazing - as is the cast, and living the suspense with both characters instead of dramatic irony is really quite unique and exhilarating.7.5/10.",30 December 2023

It shows me a beautiful bond by two people and then proceeds to reference it constantly throughout the movie reminding me of the past (a good thing) this movie has incredible storytelling and a clever twist. It is a very wild plot, but we are settled into it so amazingly. Soon enough we are watching several hundred dogs chase a man with a floating house, a Boy Scout, a talking dog and a mysterious random bird. And the leader of these dogs is a man gone rogue/crazy who was once the idol of Carl and Ellie. I find that Russell confides in Carl because he never had a proper father figure. And Carl loves Russell deeply because he never got to have children of his own. The villain is one of the most creative I've ever seen. He was an idol. They bonded over him and fell in love. But when they finally meet him he is a crazy mean guy who kills for fortune. This movie makes me cry for sadness and happiness. Carl goes crazy trying to complete the one goal him and Ellie had. But he has to learn to move on and that love is in the moment. We can look on the last but we must love who we have now and where we are. I think one of the most important moments in this movie is when Carl sits down in his newly placed home, completely alone, and he reflects on ""The adventure book"" that Ellie made. Further proof that he only thinks about what he wants and how to replicate what he had. But he never looked past the ""things I'm going to do"" part. Because it had pictures of him and Ellie all through it. And at the end it has a note form Ellie. ""Thanks for the adventure - now go have a new one!"" This made me ball my eyes out. This could not be more of a sign that the real Ellie wouldn't want him to pursue their goals, but would want him to continue on with his life and have new adventures. Beautiful. And the book changed him so much that he threw out a bunch of chairs and photos and memorabilia from his and Ellie's life. Showing us that he had moved on. INCREDIBLE. And then the cherry on top, his house floats away and it symbolises him moving on from Ellie. THEN CARL GOES TO HIS CEREMONY AND GIVES HIM ELLIES GRAPE SODA PIN I CANT.

A curious fact: the place represented as a destination point for Carl's trip - the fictional Paradise Falls - exists on the real life, in the border between Venezuela and Brazil: its Mount Roraima.The most touching on this film is to see the love of Carl and Ellie, alive even after her death and visible in the way he keeps her memory alive and ever present.

",4,"A film of two halves for me. The first half I did enjoy the second half I thought was far fetched to the point of absurdity. On a technical level the film is well made, many Nolan's best looking film too? The art direction, costumes, sound and editing are all handled fantastically, thing look great in HD. The film was nominated for a couple of Oscars but didn't win any.Hugh Jackman plays an American, Christian Bale plays an Englishman and Scarlett Johansson plays an Englishwoman, this is well done. Michael Caine still plays himself, he is given some interesting material. He pretty much plays Alfred the butler again though, the knowledgeable, calm and caring father figure like character in the story. The cinematography is nice we get some neither shots on snowy hills shot from high above, the streets of London in darkness are nicely recreated and felt real and lived in. The film early on is a bit too epic in it's estimation of itself, we get these dramatic push ins on main characters as they delivered fairly undramatic and unnatural sounding dialogue. A lot of the film though has this slick, clean, look, where everything looks amazing, the lighting and so on looks a bit to amazing for what they could do back then in a 19th century theatre. When it comes to the characters you don't get a real sense that this really is 19th England, around the same time period where Oscar Wilde was at the height of his fame or Rudyard Kipling was delighting the public with his tales of Empire. The main issue with the period setting was the costume worn by magaicans assistant which consists basically of a corset and a pair of boots. Ladies couldn't even show their ankles back then, I sincerely doubt she would have been strutting around the stage wearing next to nothing on stage. They don't even try not giving Bale a modern haircut. He just looks like Bruce Wayne in Batman Begins. He doesn't even wear a hat either when walking outside. Did this film either not do it's research or just not care about the 1890s?The film is pretty to look at as I've said, colours are quite rich and details in clothing fabric show up clearly. The film starts at the end in a sense with a murder trial under way before using flashbacks to reveal what happened, Nolan loves a film that doesn't all take place in the right order. The film itself reveals how some tricks are done, how ""volunteers"" from the audience are often in on the act, I found this bit interesting. There's some tense scenes involving dangerous tricks, the public soon get bored and demand more and more impossible tricks.After a while though it starts to get a bit comical how Bale and Jackman keep popping up to spoil each other's tricks. If they hate each other so much why don't they just murder each other and get it over with? Or I guess then we wouldn't have a story.....
I'm not sure if I'd re-watch the film again. It's quite dark, and neither Bale and Jackman actually play a very likeable character by the end, so why should we care too much who wins?The film has some of those horrible logical flaws so common in a Nolan movie. Where is Jackman getting the money from to build a Teleporter! Logic rarely enters into a Nolan film, it's more about the spectacle and the emotion behind it. The themes in this are of obsession and rivalry, both men go to ludicrous lengths to beat the other. Almost to the point of comedy as I said before.Unfortunately you spot the big twist/reveal coming half way through. The main complaint about the film, which others have made too is that it pretends to be a period drama then suddenly at the ends it's a sci-fi film, Hugh Jackman has been cloning himself - that's one of the big twists, it's so silly you almost want to turn the film off, it's that bad. We can barley clone sheep in 2021, how is he doing all this in the 1890s?All in all a mixed review from me. Technically the film is excellent, story wise it's not for me.",27 December 2023

I've never experienced anything like it. I mean who would've thought that the biggest trick from a film about tricks would be the film itself? And it's the ending (or should I say 'The Prestige'?) that makes you realise this. Personally I did somewhat figure out the twist during The Turn (Act 2), but as John Cutter uttered in his closing monologue, ""you're looking for the secret, but you won't find it of course, you're not really looking. You don't really want to work it out. You want to be fooled."" And I realised after hearing this line that that is exactly what happened to me! I allowed myself to be easily fooled even after I'd solved the trick, and the reason why I was so easily fooled was purely thanks to both the phenomenal writing of Christopher Nolan, and even the video editing (as there was very little focus on the thing that gives the finale away).As for the rest of this masterpiece, the cinematography was surprisingly beautiful, and the performances from all the cast were superb, with the most notable ones coming from Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, and Michael Caine, the latter of whom's monologues were a lovely touch to the film, I really believe those were key to this being such a showpiece.To summarise, this is an unbelievable feature, and I can now see why this is some people's favourite Nolan flick, as it left me with my jaw dropped to the floor.",23 December 2023

First of all, the editing of the film is very good. Nolan really designed the fiction very cleverly. For example, at the beginning of the movie, he shows us a scene that is usually in the middle of the movie. And after watching the scene, we come to a conclusion. Then the film shows how things came to this stage. And our opinions about the scene we watched at the beginning completely change. Everything starts to sit in your head. You fall in love with the fiction and the details. And the movie ends by hitting you deeply with its magnificent finale at the end. It's arguably the best ending I've ever seen in a movie in my life. Especially very good at the desired message to be given at the end. And even though the script of the film is fiction, he supported it by using events that happened in real life.

The legendary film ""Doctor Strangelove"" is not only one of the most amazing comedies in the history of cinema, but also a very subtle and intelligent political satire, uncompromisingly ridiculing the entire political insanity of the ruling elite of the ""two nuclear superpowers.""In this film, Kubrick boldly addresses almost all pressing political issues. We are witnessing a real circus of freaks, in which the main clowns are: generals, politicians, ambassadors and, finally, leaders of governments. The plot of the film subsequently twists in such a dizzying spiral that one is left amazed at the skill of the great author, who managed to maintain style and taste without slipping into cheap shock value scenes. Stanley Kubrick brilliantly deconstructs the many archetypes of the Cold War. It is deconstructed in a very unbiased way. Each of the characters in the picture represents something. Kubrick seems to encrypt entertaining ideological agendas in his characters, delivering a harsh verdict on each of the opposing political systems.Truly one of the best political satires of the 20th century.",26 December 2023

",9,"A great film by a great director. The film presents itself as a comedy and the hilarious trait is evident in the script, however beyond the comedy there is much more. Kubrick makes fun of the political system and tells a story full of absurdities. A mad commander who orders the bombing of the USSR, a nationalist general who gets excited at the thought of a nuclear war, a president who does not know the laws he has enacted, and then the great Dr. Strangelove, a former Nazi who finds a plan, also absurd, to save humanity. Certainly it is all aimed at generating a smile in the viewer, but it is also a critique of war by an anti-militarist Kubrick that could already be appreciated in 'Paths of Glory'. All those differences between communists and Americans seem to fall away in this film. For instance, the American president, as well as the Soviet president, are incapable of handling the defence and/or attack systems they created. Even more significant is the scene in which American soldiers are mistaken as Soviet enemies, so Kubrick seems to suggest that that big difference is not really there and therefore that a war would be a dastardly act. ""The End of the World Device"" embodies the fears of the world at the time, as there was a real fear that an atomic war might break out in which neither side would prevail. Fortunately it never happened, but Kubrick emphasises that the fate of the world is in the hands of men who as such are fallible. However, what was feared would happen in reality happens in the film and the only solution found is that of Doctor Strangelove. This too is absurd: the Soviets and Americans were united by hatred for the Nazis, yet they accept a Nazi's crazy plan to save humanity. In this way Strangelove, perhaps the craziest of characters, appears as the most rational in a room of even crazier politicians and generals.",12 December 2023

Yes, the first two Inspector Clouseau movies came through the theaters, during the previous two years before this film, but it was Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964), that really put Sellers over the top. He plays three different roles in this film. They are characters ranging from, a British Officer, an ex-Nazi advisor and the President of the United States. This Stanley Kubrick classic tackles the red-hot topic of the early-1960s, which was the Cold War of the post-atomic era. It latches onto the paranoias and phobias of that era, just two years after the Cuban Missile Crisis. It joins a genre, that was started in the late-1950s, with films like, On the Beach (1959). Dr. Strangelove (1964), was based off of a novel called Red Alert (1958). It parallels another film from the same year, Fail Safe (1964), which also is about military protocol systems failing, causing possible nuclear war. In the case of Dr. Strangelove (1964), a general (Sterling Hayden), who has lost his marbles, launches a nuclear strike on the Soviet Union.The difference here is, Dr. Strangelove (1964), is a satirized, dark comedy, about the subject of nuclear annihilation, that allows its great cast, to do what they do best and perform an array of, beautifully ridiculous characters. Along with Peter Sellers and Sterling Hayden, a cast containing George C. Scott, Keenan Wynn, Slim Pickens and James Earl Jones, does deliver a wonderfully dark performance, that makes this film work. Kubrick uses a sleek, stylized, angular-viewpoint, utilizing great black and white filmstock, that gives the film a grittiness with its serious undertone, while the actors roll-out the laughs. Being as it was 1964, the best way for Kubrick to handle the jet-bomber footage, with the technology of the times, was to shoot aerial footage and back-project it, in front of the plane interior windows or with models of the jet, in front of the screen in a studio. There are shots of the jet, utilizing real aerial footage in the film, but most of these scenes used matted footage with a model, which was the precursor to green-screen. The jet model in front of the screen, may look archaic by 21 century terms, but it helps emphasize the comedy-side of the film. Plus, the effects do look good and took these dedicated, 1960s filmmakers, probably weeks to shoot, with additional weeks, trying to edit those scenes together.

The humorous tone works not only as comedy, but as criticism. It's a film about war, more specifically the Cold War, which represents the hunt for communists. It is possible to identify several criticisms of the American government. Americans are portrayed as a hypocritical government that doesn't mind hurting innocents if it would save its people, even if they weren't the target of any attack. It's an excellent criticism of the United States, but it also makes fun of communism. As good as it is, I don't think it's excellent or one of the greatest films in the history of cinema.

The director did a very good job with choosing when to switch between the different viewpoints shown in the movie. The timing made it to where the movie never really got boring and gave that comedic relief at just the right time. There was also a lot of depth added with the way they chose to have the American and the Russians interact to try and prevent conflict.

I actually consider this movie to be quite funny but it really does highlight he ridiculousness of both nuclear warfare and the cold War itself. It shows how so few men, that you could fit into one room, have the power to practically destroy the world. And the odds of one of such men becoming obsessed or crazy is very high. Not only that bur Dr strangelove himself is very clearly a nazi similar to how another well know nazi Werner Von Brauhn was cleared of his war crimes and made head of Nasa during the cold War.

The ending is a masterpiece.The only drawback, however, is that the women in this movie are only the playthings of the rich and powerful, and the lack of women makes it difficult to create a more radical political stance, but rather it seems to be heading towards a traditional ""anti-American"" or ""anti-political"" ending. The fact that the film seems to satirize all of these ideologies without having a dominant position of its own is, in my opinion, a kind of compromise and cowardice on Kubrick's part.",12 November 2023

",7,"The story fits nicely into 3 acts, the introduction, the training and finally the combat sequences. The real strength of the film lies in it's final act, the direction is superb as we the audience are hurled into the hell of battle, all it's trauma, fear, brutality and horror. I couldn't think of a single bad performance and the supporting cast are all actually quite well developed given the limited time we have to get to know them. The story is about Desmond Doss a straight-talking high minded individual who simultaneously pursues a romantic engagement and tries to enlist in the army while refusing to take up arms, wishing instead to serve as a medic. He freely admits to being a consciousness objector, his convictions are of course mistaken for cowardice and every obstacle is thrown in front of him in an effort to get him out.The film course boasts very high production values and the close quarter fighting sequences have to be seen to be believed. I fully recommend the Blu Ray experience despite the dull colour scheme in the third act, with it's grey, brown and green colours, together with it's smoky backdrop and handheld camera work the visuals none the less are atoningly good. In close ups every scratch on a helmet is Clearly seen as is every tiny speck of dried blood on a person's forehead. The art department deserve full credit for their work. The score is what you'd expect from this genera of film of war and heroism and the sound design is probably more important than the visuals in portraying the terrors of battle. The only moment shots which looked a little unreal were the CGI ships of the US navy, other than that everything seems to blend seamlessly. Another slight problem is that in the chaos of the fast paced fighting it's hard to tell who is who.Films these days about war often like to explore the grey areas, the moral challenges it presents to a characters ideas of right or wrong, Fury being one such example.. It's refreshing then for a film to be coming back with a sense that personal values and convictions can withstand the grim reality of war. It could also be seen as a challenge to secular ideas that religious objections should carry little to no weight in the eyes of the law and it's country. Desmond was able to make an incredible personal contribution exactly because his beliefs were made allowance for.",24 December 2023

There's no attempt to make them likeable and the film doesn't ask us to. Robert De Niro gives such a natural performance, so much of his acting is in what's not said rather than what is. His gestures, his stares, his rampant paranoia, suspicion and jealousy. Over the course of the film he's married twice and acts like an animals to both women. Equally he fights like an animal in the ring too, a superb boxer with a growing reputation.Shot in gorgeous black and white and superbly directed by Martin Scorsese this ranks right up with his very best work and one of the best films of the 1980s. In the ring the action is fast and intense, the camera is largely handheld getting you right into the middle between these two men as the blows rain in. You see the sweat on their faces knocked into the air in slow motion by the punches to the head. The production design is great, you really believe the classic look of the film, the production design, the images of the Madonna hang over the walls, the cramped apartments, the classic cars. There's also a great Steadicam shot showing him on his way to the ring.I found his relationship with his brother the most interesting part. As the character continues to self-destruction his relationship with his brother is destroyed, consumed by his inner demons. Throughout the film the character struggles with his weight but finds himself unfit for any further boxing. He balloons into an overweight nightclub owner, De Niro put on a huge amount of weight for this final part. He slips further and further into the gutter, forced to sell his boxing belts and even finds himself in a prison cell at one point.

Raging Bull was produced by Chartoff/Winkler who won the Best Picture Oscar as the producers of Rocky.With Martin Scorsese as director, this is a very different boxing movie. There is nothing uplifting about Jake La Motta. He is a man consumed with anger, jealousy, hate, neurosis. An animal in the ring and outside it.Scorsese makes a very technical but explosive movie in black and white. The boxing sequences are visceral, to capture the brutality of boxing. The editing is superb.At the heart of the movie is De Niro. He had one mission for Raging Bull. To become the best screen actor in the world.

He has directed some good films. But his method / signature is often: Select a time period, assemble a playlist of favorite tunes from that period, write a story around the playlist. It all becomes so predictable. And boring.As for Raging Bull: Scorsese chooses to center his story on a violent, ignorant man who abuses two wives and who ends up doing a pathetic stand-up routine in a Florida lounge. WTF?My 2 stars are for the cinematography. B&W perfectly captures the essence of 40s newsreels and early 50s TV.",28 November 2023
rw9378191,ur33162918,tt0081398," Visually stunning and profound in its themes, ""Raging Bull"" leaves an important reflection on the damage that a lack of emotional control can cause in our lives
",9,"Extremely realistic and at the same time sensitive, the film has the impeccable direction of Martin Scorsese, who as usual uses very creative shots, especially during the fights, through close-ups on La Motta, shots of the canvas and ropes dripping with blood and even even the use of slow motion to accentuate the effect of some blows. Incredibly realistic, Scorsese's direction allows the viewer to practically feel the weight of the gloves, the emotion of the combat and the vibration of the audience.The script by Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin, based on a book by Jake La Motta, Joseph Carter and Peter Savage, uses the street language (verborrhagic and full of swear words) traditional in Scorsese's films to show in detail how Jake's explosive temper took him to rock bottom and peak, covering many years of the boxer's life without ever sounding tiring. Merit also goes to the excellent editing by Thelma Schoonmaker, who sets an interesting rhythm throughout the entire narrative, using different visual styles to demonstrate the passage of time. Note, for example, the archive of photos and slow-motion images of Jake's fights, followed by a fun colorful video that summarizes the events in the La Motta family (such as the brothers' weddings), underlined by a nostalgic soundtrack, and which ends with worn images in an aged video, reminiscent of newspaper images. This sequence only lasts a few minutes, but covers a period of more than three years in his life.Quite dynamic in its rhythm, the film manages, from the beginning, to substantiate a large part of the character's life without becoming long or dull. Each scene has its importance in putting together the puzzle about the man's attitudes. And based on this dynamicity, we begin to have an initial overview of the unevenness that the film intends to adhere to. LaMotta followed, even before gaining evidence in his boxing career, a pattern of harmful behavior, whether for his family, such as his brother and his wife, or for himself, preventing him from obtaining all the advances that his talent had given him. Irascible, LaMotta refuses to promote a social exchange that would possibly help him in his professional career, opting to rely on his own strength, becoming a solitary and wandering being. Here, the only force that the man allows to make changes in his life is that of his brother.His brother serves as a social brake on his extreme attitudes. Just like a mindless animal, LaMotta is guided by his brother in every sphere of his life. On a professional level, this brother will manage his career, choosing rivals and working behind the scenes for LaMotta to get the opportunity to compete for the belt in his category. On a personal level, this brother will be responsible for simply everything the man does, serving as a bridge, for example, for LaMotta to meet the second wife exposed in the film.Technically impeccable, the film also features excellent photography direction by Michael Chapman. The beautiful contrast between black and white creates beautiful images, avoids a bloodbath for the viewer and can even be interpreted as Jake's point of view, since theoretically the ""bulls"" also see the world in black and white. The magnificent sound work works perfectly, capturing each blow delivered by the boxers with incredible realism, mixed with the fast narration of the fight and the intense vibration of the audience. And last but not least, the beautiful theme song from the beautiful soundtrack by Robbie Robertson (Cavalleria Rusticana: Intermezzo, composed by Pietro Mascagni) reflects very well the nostalgic state of mind of La Motta, who threw away everything he achieved in your life.Having said all this, we finally arrive at the character that inspired this entire production. Jake La Motta is a simple human being, innocent even, but extremely explosive, as we can see in his first appearance outside the ring, when he complains about dinner and turns the tables. This scene perfectly symbolizes Robert De Niro's stupendous performance, when upon hearing his neighbor shouting at the window (a team technician placed on purpose by Scorsese without him knowing), he improvises a dialogue that was not in the script. Instead of stopping the filming of the scene, he got into the spirit of it and told the nosy neighbor to swear. Things from those who know. In addition to the countless scenes in which his talent stands out to the audience (Jake's crying after giving up a fight is one of them), his physical transformation is also notable in the first transition from 1964 to 1941. Often naive, Jake was in control. With enormous talent and brutal strength, capable of scaring his brother Joey's (Joe Pesci) friends when the two-practice boxing. Socially out of place, his direct manner is also responsible for winning over the woman of his dreams, young Vickie (Cathy Moriarty). His passion for Vickie, however, would be responsible for exposing how possessive and jealous he was, generating extreme reactions. Suspicious beyond the limit, as becomes evident at a dinner with his brother's friends, Jake begins to demonstrate his unhealthy jealousy when he reacts rudely to a simple sentence from his wife about an opponent who was ""young and handsome"". Jake spends days thinking about it, even talking to Vickie about it and seriously reflecting on it, revealing how much it disturbed and hurt him. The result of Vickie's sentence was the massacre of Janiro, the ""handsome young man"", to the point where a spectator in the audience said that ""this one can no longer be called handsome"".On the other hand, her rudeness didn't mean he didn't love or care about her. In the same way that he offended her, and even attacked her, he showed concern and affection, like when he asked his brother to take her home and take care of her. The brothers, in fact, also treated each other aggressively, but they had deep respect and admiration for each other. In this same discussion at Jake's house, Joey himself is rude to his wife, but tries to advise his brother to take care of Vickie, which leads to their reconciliation soon after. Joe Pesci, in fact, offers another excellent performance as the brother who takes care of Jake's career and is capable of beating up his friend Salvy (Frank Vincent) to defend him. Vickie, in turn, never stops living with her circle of friends, no matter how much she loved her husband. Often lonely, due to his constant routine of fights and travels, she tries to alleviate her loneliness by having fun, which only contributes to increasing the boxer's paranoia.Played with great sensuality by Cathy Moriarty, she goes over the limit when she kisses businessman Tommy (Nicholas Colasanto) in front of her husband, provoking his violent reaction. It becomes clear then that Jake, as much as he loved his brother and his wife, did not measure the consequences of his actions, acting instinctively. Totally emotional and not at all rational, he was capable of distrusting his own brother, as he makes clear in the conversation in which, completely out of shape and irritated by the television, he questions the reason for his fight with Salvy and goes so far as to ask if Joey had already had sex with Vickie. At this moment, Joey demonstrates how much he knew his brother, as he knew that if he said what had happened in the bar, he would explode in a way that no one would be able to contain. Vickie, on the other hand, did not have the same wisdom, and perhaps even as a way of provoking her husband, stated that she had already had sex with Joey and all of his friends, provoking the anger of the bull who, untamed, goes out in fury to punch the brother and his wife in front of Joey's family, in an incredibly realistic scene. He doesn't think, he just acts, like a true animal.De Niro's enormous transformation in La Motta's interview with his family at home, followed by his astonishing performance in the nightclub, confirms the talent of this incredible actor. Watch how he, in front of the cameras, tries to be more polite with his wife, even asking if she has finished talking. La Motta's depressing ending, as a fat, assh*le bar owner, leads to his wife finally being able to leave him. To make things even worse, he is arrested for allowing underage people into his bar, and he can't even pay bail, even selling the jewelry from his championship belt. The shot in which Jake punches the cell wall, sunk in the shadows (reflecting his emotional state) and shouting that he is an idiot is moving. He repeats that ""he's not bad, he's not an animal and he's not this guy"", in a brilliant and emotional performance by Robert De Niro. Upon leaving prison, he transforms into a decadent and deplorable bar host. However, his last sentence inside the ring (""You never knocked me down!"") demonstrates the other side of this inner fury he carried, responsible for creating a myth in the ring. Even defeated, the giant never fell.Jake's conversation with the mirror, quoting Marlon Brando in ""Syndicate of Thieves"", contains the film's great message. He could have been someone much better, but he was not protected, suddenly falling from the top (heaven) to the ground (hell). In the dangerous game of fame, not being dazzled by the present and planning for the future is essential to avoid a decadent ending like this. When the beautiful soundtrack, accompanied by a biblical passage, closes this moving masterpiece by Scorsese, we are still in a trance-like state, completely mesmerized by the wonderful work we have just witnessed. Visually stunning and profound in its themes, the poignant, vibrant and incredibly realistic ""Raging Bull"" knocks out the viewer in the same way that Jake La Motta destroyed opponents. And as a bonus, it leaves an important reflection on the damage that a lack of emotional control can cause in our lives.",15 October 2023
rw9355211,ur171075521,tt0081398," Would You Do the Right Thing?
",8,"Do the Right Thing (1989), written, produced, directed, and headlined by Spike Lee, is a social justice film inspired by mountings racial tensions in urban areas throughout the United States during the late 1980s. That brings awareness to the disturbing truth of the intolerance towards cultural diversity, police brutality, and even subtly hints at issues related to global warming. The film effectively portrays the reality of this time from the perspective of its protagonist Mookie, a black pizza delivery man played by Lee himself, as he navigates through the intimate spaces of this singular block in Brooklyn over the course of just one sweltering hot twenty-four-hour period.Considered one of the most significant political films of all time, Do the Right Thing is quite comparable to Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator in that they are not only masterpieces created by two writer-director-actors, but also because of the similarly powerful themes of unjust oppression, violence, and intolerance that particular culturally diverse groups that remains relevant, and continues to reach present-day audiences more than 30 years after their release.The skillful use of each key element of mise-en-scene really stood out to me. With New York City's history of being known as the most culturally diverse cities in the world, there is arguably no other setting that could have better depicted the racial theme than the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. We see What's more is the way in which Lee places the characters as either insiders or outsiders depending on the cultural norms of the particular setting of each scene (e.g., the pizzeria, apartments, sidewalks, stoops, or convenience store). Every single element of the film is symbolic, from the classic hip-hop and R&B music, the iconic colorful 1980s street style threads worn by the characters, to the notable performances sprinkled with humor. Even the sweltering heat was intended to be symbolic in that rising temperatures symbolizes rising tensions leading up to the turbulent riot.The way in which Lee uses comedy to challenge the existing state of these times and forces audiences to re-evaluate their own stances on the matter and decide how or whether they'd react to such systemic racism sets this film apart and makes it a must see for all.",3 October 2023

rw9342746,ur164036594,tt0081398," A tour de force in filmmaking, but to watch ""Raging Bull"" in the same way as ""Goodfellas"" might be a mistake
",10,"It had been quite a few years since I've seen ""Raging Bull"", and while I've loved it since the first time I watched it, it has never placed at or near the very top of my Scorsese rankings. The reason, I think, is simple: it's not as entertaining as a film like ""Goodfellas"" or maybe even ""The Departed"" and the character of Jake LaMotta, while he's riveting to watch onscreen, is such a barbaric creature devoid of any redemption surviving on apparent fumes of humanity that he is not as likable as another complicated, prone-to-violence man portrayed by Robert De Niro in Travis Bickle.It has become clear to me on my latest re-watch of ""Raging Bull"", which I saw through the incredible Criterion 4K that this is the least fun and humorous of the great films that Scorsese made throughout the seventies through to nineties (excluding ""Kundun"" of course). While this could result easily result in tedium or a feeling of self-importance, under Scorsese's direction and De Niro's gargantuan performance, this is one of the most exhilarating, uncompromising and utterly fascinating character studies that has ever been committed to film.The filmmaking here is jaw dropping, especially in the boxing matches. The slow motion, the noir-ish use of shadows and angles and the sound design give the boxing matches a visceral flair rarely seen in a sport film especially up to this point. The cinematography, editing and overall tempo of the 'action' scenes really highlight how much of a brute LaMotta is in the ring and some of the damage that he does to his opponents borders on cringe-inducing.LaMotta's brute-like behaviour in the ring is matched in his domestic life and there are a number of key relationships here. His brother Joey (Pesci) is his manager and you get a sense of just how much he has changed his personality to accommodate for Jake's animalistic and volatile personality. The relationship and marriage with Vickie (Moriarty) is fascinating and we as the viewer know immediately, without needing to know the real life story between the two, that Vickie is doomed to repeat the same cycle of abuse and oppression as Jake's previous (and current at the beginning of the film) wife and it's fitting that in their first meeting, Vickie is behind a barbed fence and LaMotta is on the outside. Lastly, the relationships Jake has with Tommy (the Mafia boss) and Sal (Vincent) are interesting because he is really not impressed by the power either guy has and makes it especially clear with Sal that he does not respect that lifestyle. For Jake, it's all about the personal journey to get to the middleweight championship and he does not want his story as one of the foremost boxers, of Italian American blood, owing his rise to the top to the Mafia.Martin Scorsese's ""Raging Bull"" is one of his more sobering and dark films but what it lacks in straightforward entertainment, it makes up for in complex characterization and rich emotion. It's one of the great exhibitions in filmmaking and the collaboration with De Niro arguably is at its apex here in terms of the artistic contributions of both Scorsese and De Niro. There is no killer soundtrack in this film like there is in ""Goodfellas"" and the film is not ripe with comedy because it is from the warped perspective of its single focal point and that is Jake LaMotta but it becomes apparent to me now that it was a mistake for me to have viewed this as lesser, though great, than both ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Goodfellas"".",26 September 2023

",9,"""Raging Bull"" is a film directed by the world-renowned Martin Scorsese and produced by Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff. It was filmed in 1980 and it is thought of by many as one of the great movies of all time. ""Raging Bull"" is a biography of the boxing champion Jake LaMotta. It is a great look into both the personal and professional struggles, and triumphs, of LaMotta.Robert De Niro absolutely crushes the roll of Jake LaMotta. This was one of his best works, and a film that help allow him become such a bankable actor. Like most of De Niro's great films, his strength, focus, and energy shine through in the film. He is an actor that truly becomes the character his is playing. Joe Pesci plays Jake's brother Joey LaMotta. Their relationship in the film is a difficult one, but the chemistry between De Niro and Pesci is easy to see. They, and sometimes Scorsese, teamed up in several different films.The film begins with Jake winning a number of fights in impressive fashion. After some subsequent struggles both inside and out of the ring, Jake does something that he will regret forever. After regaining his success in the ring, Jake finally wins his championship. Throughout all this, his brother Joey is by his side giving Jake advice and sometimes drawing the ire of his brother. The film ends as Jake is still struggling with his many demons outside the ring.While I obviously enjoyed the film, I do think the fight scenes are a little unrealistic and over the top. They lack the real nuance of the sport and look like fight scenes out of mortal combat or another video game to me. Also, not that it didn't happen in real life, but there was a lot of violence in the film and was difficult to watch at times.This is a great movie, especially for a sports fan like me. The highlights are Robert De Niro's portrayal of the complex Jake Lamotta, and the obvious chemistry of De Niro and Pesci as Jake and Joey Lamotta. Anyone who loves a great drama, and can handle a little violence, will love this film.",24 September 2023

",10,"""The Usual Suspects"" certainly defies pigeon holing or labeling! Its larger-than-life allure results from a seamless blending of elements: Psychodrama, Action, Suspense and Mystery, all built on intricate storytelling, a dynamic screenplay and taught direction, by Bryan Singer. The aforementioned are all bolstered by credible in-depth character development, brought to life by an outstanding cast, who flesh out each role to chilling near perfection. (Kevin Spacey, seen here before most people would have recognized his name, received an Oscar for his ""supporting"" role!)But let's not get sidetracked. More than anything else,""SUSPECTS"" is about the unparalleled unsettling reaction you get from viewing it! From the first scene to the end credits, it gets a headlock on your psyche, while sending the pit of your stomach into endless free fall! The only way to illustrate this, without giving away any key elements of the film, is a detailed look at the opening scene....a peerless example of instant timeless classic film noir.On a boat, docked in San Pedro Harbor, the dying sole-survivor of an apparently devastating bloodbath shootout, painfully ignites a thin trail of gasoline. His obvious intention: Destroy EVERYTHING...himself included! From a deck higher up, an unseen someone pisses out the trail of flames.The shadowy figure then casually walks down the stairs with an unhurried deliberation and saunters over to the agonizing man he has just saved. They exchange somewhat forced greetings and a few disjointed words of banter.Without warning, the intruder firmly raises a pistol, his unblinking gaze reflected in eyes locked in contact with his own. Unhesitatingly, he fires two consecutive shots. A brief pause of contemplation ends when he casually lights a cigarette, strategically dropping his lighter to rekindle the liquid fuse, and then beats a hasty off-board retreat.What better way to introduce a character whose twisted iron resolve is so perverse, so deranged, that he saves a doomed man seconds before certain death, solely for the unmitigated pleasure derived from looking him squarely in the eye, his victim looking right back, while pulling the trigger himself. Without uttering a syllable, his actions shout out, ""I piss on you and your puny existence!"" His victim's final moments are thusly converted into a living/dying testimony, clearly demonstrating who it is that decides the particulars of when and how he will die!""SUSPECTS"" has been severely critiqued by a vocal minority (to paraphrase another reviewer) for not knowing the difference between a plot twist and a non sequitur. With all due respect to the reviewer, who painstakingly highlighted the difference for us, perhaps a careful second viewing would shed some light on the source of this common confusion. After watching ""SUSPECTS"" four times making every effort to employ my most discerning eye, I am convinced the true genius of the movie hinges on this particular point!Let me underscore my unequivocal recommendation of this film with a special note to those of you who avoid the Action or Suspense genre because of your distaste of the excessive violence that generally characterizes them. Well, THIS IS NO Robert Rodriguez FILM! A lot of the scenes are done in the ""Old School"" style, where the violence is kept off-screen.Although there is considerable TALK in ""SUSPECTS"" about some of the most dastardly deeds imaginable, virtually none of this is graphically portrayed. So, PLEASE, if you have not seen it yet, because of this reason, I urge you to make an exception in this case...10* STARS! YOU MUST GET IT AND WATCH IT... CAREFULLY!!!",19 December 2023

While everyone is good in their respective roles, Spacey manages to take his role further with remarkable simplicity, whether it's his dialogue delivery, vacant expressions, or cerebral palsy. The character of Keyser Söze looms over the plot so much that he is already an iconic figure way before appearing on the screen.Overall, The Usual Suspects is a tense, confusing, captivating, and entertaining film that delivers a mind-blowing experience the first time around. It's so meticulously crafted with the subtle placement of hints that it requires a bit of commitment from its audience, but the reward, in the end, is incredibly fulfilling, too.

Well after the recent Major League Cricket season here in the US, I very quickly became obsessed with the sport, It's brilliant. But this is not a review of the sport cricket (Although I'd also give it a 10/10), it's a review of the film.This film grips you in the first 30 minutes and it does not let go till the credits, and at almost 4 hours long that's impressive. Trust me time will fly. Although some moments might have slowed the pace a little for me personally like the song during the religious festival it didn't bother me cause the music is awesome.The story is pretty standard but it's so brilliantly told that it feels Shakespearean in character writing and proportions. Like seriously the characters are awesome. Each one is so unique and the way their personalities translated to their cricket game is just perfect.The villain is phenomenal as well. By the end of the 4 hours you will be praying for his downfall and spoilers, he gets what's coming. I mean I'm a white guy and I was chanting ""DESTROY THE WHITE MAN"" with the movie as well.Now one thing that I would preface is that I believe it would help to at least gain a basic understanding of how cricket works just for your enjoyment, although towards the end the movie you'll probably pick up the basics, idk.That being said, I could definitely go on but I gotta cut this short.

Most viewers were getting a feel of it being closer to Dilip Kumar Saahab's classic Naya Daur (1957) and even some articles were written doubting its commercial viability.15th June 2001. Lagaan released in cinemas at a time when I was travelling to Baroda for office work. I browsed the in-flight newspaper for the review and it is only then I realised that the film was all about a cricket match being played by local villagers against the British officers in lieu of their tax (lagaan) waiver. The setting was 1890s when Indians didnt know what cricket was and the closest game they played was gilli danda.Ashutosh Gowariker's spectacular vision was given an open hand by Aamir Khan who invested lot of his money to lend authenticity to the script. The production values were A grade, the supporting cast was perfect, AR Rahman was hired to compose some outstanding tunes and bgm and above all, there was no compromise made to Gowariker's creativity.Yup, Lagaan turned out to be a lengthy feature at close to four hours (with interval). At a Baroda single screen where I caught it, the film had two intervals with the final hour and half turning in to a cricket stadium with the audience standing and cheering Aamir's Team Champaner.Clashing with Sunny Deol- Ameesha Patel blockbuster Gadar Ek Prem Katha, Lagaan managed to be a box office success. It swept the Filmfare awards that year and then achieved ultimate glory by getting an Oscar nomination. Wish it had won that trophy. Never mind!! The film is above all awards and accolades and will always feature in any list of Bollywood classics. Just like its peer and fellow Oscar nominee Mother India (1957)!!Regards,

rw9539320,ur80693802,tt0076759," Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope is a flawed masterpiece, an adventure you won't forget that pushed the boundaries of special effects - My Ultimate Review
",10,"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope is a sci-fi masterpiece, although it has some flaws it's just easy to look past. This is a Star Wars film I've seen more times than I can count and now it's my second time seeing it on 4K Blu-ray, honestly, each frame looks stunning and is full of detail. This is one of those 4k remasters which is simply perfect with Dolby Vision and HDR which enhances the experience and picture quality immensely. The Dolby Atmos track is too perfect, making it easy to understand why the film won an award for best sound and music. George Lucas directed and wrote the film, also creating ILM for the extensive special effects work on the film. It's a flawed masterpiece as with this film, you see the flaws that George clearly has, but how he went through with his vision and stuck with it. We got one of the best sci-fi films and possibly the best sci-fi franchise thanks to him, a storyteller and visionary. Star Wars was a surprise hit, surpassing Jaws (1975) to become the highest-grossing film until the release of E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982); subsequent releases brought its total gross to $775 million. When adjusted for inflation, Star Wars is the second-highest-grossing film in North America and the fourth-highest-grossing film of all time.Luke Skywalker joins forces with a Jedi Knight, a cocky pilot, a Wookiee and two droids to save the galaxy from the Empire's world-destroying battle station, while also attempting to rescue Princess Leia from the mysterious Darth Vader.There's a ton of likable characters in this trilogy (Episode IV-VI) and this was the start. We have an inexperienced Mark Hamill who plays Luke Skywalker, what's interesting is how you see his acting improve throughout the film. Then we have Harrison Ford as the charismatic Han Solo who gets all the funny lines which are made funny because of his delivery. His performance is one of the highlights, I could say the same about Hamill and Fisher's who got a career after this film. We have Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia Organa, Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anthony Daniels as C-3PO and Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca. On the villain side we have; Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin, David Prowse as Darth Vader with James Earl Jones doing the voice for the character, a voice a bit unknown back in the day, but a voice that became iconic. The characters are excellent and the acting can be all from good to average and even below average at times, but that's completely alright with a film with this much heart. I can't help to smile, laugh, and be entertained every single time I watch this film.It's known to the public how George Lucas was inspired by Akira Kurosawa's films, for example The Hidden Fortress with Toshiro Mifune being Lucas' number one pick for Obi-Wan Kenobi but it wasn't meant to be instead we got Alec Guinness in the role which was great. Regarding the inspiration of The Hidden Fortress, you see how the story and characters were heavily inspired. The two peasants from that film who banter with each other throughout the movie, you see their personalities in R2D2 and 3CPO. Then we have the samurai and princess, Jedi and Princess in this film. Another big influence was of course Flash Gordon but I'll go into another one, Lawrence of Arabia (1962) which inspired the film's visual approach, including long-lens desert shots. There are also thematic parallels, including the freedom fight by a rebel army against an empire, and politicians who meddle behind the scenes. He uses this inspiration and creates something brilliant, something memorable, a landmark in cinema. One big reason for why it's so memorable, is because of the production design and art direction, it's truly something special, with Ralph McQuarrie's concept art and illustrations helping make Star Wars so special and epic.This film, the first Star Wars film, has some mesmerizing shots. The film looks absolutely stunning and it's thanks to the brilliant cinematography by Gilbert Taylor along with the director. George Lucas had a new camera made for the film for the extensive special effects shots. Dykstra's development of this first digital motion control camera system earned himself, Al Miller, and Jerry Jeffress Academy Awards in 1978. If I would have been at the cinema during the theatrical release, I would have been completely mind blown of the special effects, they have aged like fine wine. The film is almost fifty years old and it'll hold up in fifty more years. John Williams' musical score makes the film so much better, it's not the best score in the trilogy though but what he contributed to the film will be remembered for centuries.Roger Ebert said this in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, ""What makes the Star Wars experience unique, though, is that it happens on such an innocent and often funny level. It's usually violence that draws me so deeply into a movie-violence ranging from the psychological torment of a Bergman character to the mindless crunch of a shark's jaws. Maybe movies that scare us find the most direct route to our imaginations. But there's hardly any violence at all in Star Wars (and even then it's presented as essentially bloodless swashbuckling). Instead, there's entertainment so direct and simple that all of the complications of the modern movie seem to vaporize."" and called the film ""an out-of-body experience"", compared its special effects to those of 2001: A Space Odyssey, and opined that the true strength of the film was its ""pure narrative"". The film garnered numerous accolades after its release. Star Wars won six competitive Academy Awards at the 50th Academy Awards: Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score, Best Sound and Best Visual Effects. Additional nominations included Alec Guinness for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and George Lucas for Best Original Screenplay, Best Director, and Best Picture. The film also received twelve nominations at the Saturn Awards, winning nine: Best Science Fiction Film, Best Direction, and Best Writing for George Lucas; Best Supporting Actor for Alec Guinness. Star Wars - A New Hope attained the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation which is a great achievement.Some final words for Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope, I fell in love with this franchise and film when I was a kid thanks to my father. Star Wars remains a film, a trilogy, a franchise which I keep coming back to without feeling bored. I'm grateful for what George Lucas created, of all the young lives he changed. A New Hope is a brilliant film, a sci-fi film perfect in so many ways. For the ones who have never seen Star Wars before, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did and still do.",3 January 2024

Michael Keaton's Ken being ridiculously smooth is fun. The fact that he turns out to be this insecure person is an excellent message: beware of those who seem too good to be true. It's very clear that toxic masculinity got him to do terrible things. And there are other straight male characters who are positive role models. On the other hand, the transphobic joke about the high heels was really gross. And the Spanish bit acts like America is the center of the universe.

This is always a good thing. It is, especially, when it is handled this well and directed at people young enough to be receptive to it, rather than rejecting it out of hand. As I type this review, it was very recent that a young woman recorded a video where she expressed frustration at having lost so much of her leisure time when she started going to work, and a lot of people including liberals, expressed no sympathy but rather mocked her as if what she was saying wasn't completely reasonable.I recommend this to every fan of the series. 8/10.",5 November 2023

",7,"I'll say it again: I'm covering the 1992 VHS release of the original Star Wars. Before George Lucas notoriously remastered the franchise with CGI.Nostalgia isn't a thing for me in most cases. After watching Star Wars on VHS, I actually think I appreciate it more now than I ever could have. There's hardly anything visually distracting about this version. Yes, it's the same movie as the modern cuts despite CGI, and the editing might not be as good as the modern cuts, but this cut looks better... This should not be the case. It might just be a placebo.If this is not a placebo, it's something to take into consideration. In other words, they somehow made Star Wars feel less coherent by adding visuals that had no right to be added. An organic film reel does something for me; I'm not saying it has to do anything for you. I'm not a Star Wars fanboy, but I want to suggest that the movie would have been better off had George Lucas left the movie intact as it was originally made. I petition that they release an HD cut of the original 1977 version. Sure, make some minor modifications to the editing if you'd like; otherwise, leave the movie untouched.Now, what about the movie itself? Well, older movies didn't have a lot of technology, so they had to make models from scratch. It's not amazing quality, but it has charm to it, considering the effort that was put into making everything look a certain way. Even if this movie wasn't intended to be phenomenal, it certainly holds up in other aspects. I think the performances saved this movie. Rather than being bland, Star Wars actually felt like it had real stakes at play in its universe. If they never made a Star Wars movie after this one, I'd argue it could stand on its own. The ending makes my point more real, as this is not a movie that ends on a direct cliffhanger. An argument could be made that the villain just floats away into the vacuum of space, and we don't even need a sequel. It works as an independent classic. For now, I will give the original Star Wars a 7 out of 10. The drawbacks are there, but it's really not that big of a deal.",28 December 2023

Paulette Goddard is wonderful in this movie and conveys so well the warmth and goodness so missing in many of her fellow humans.

In addition, it also stirred up discord and attempted to make Buzz Lightyear betray his friends. If soft doesn't work, come hard. Restore the factory settings of Buzz Lightyear and even remind Buzz Lightyear to ""be careful of them using counter measures against you"". It's too scary.

There are truck patrols, sentries, and monkeys constantly monitoring, heavily guarded, like a prison. After all, this world is not only about the beautiful side, but also about the dark side of society. The first two parts of Toy Story are also very good, but they are relatively young, and the third part is really for adults to watch.

As is consistently the case with Pixar they are superbly animated, sophisticated and had great characters. Toy Story 3 somehow managed to do the seemingly impossible, while its Toy Storys 1 and 2 have a special place in my heart, this film was even better.Perhaps Toy Story 3 isn't the most original of the trilogy or of the Pixar films, but that made little difference to me. While the darkest of the three, it still maintained the predecessors' heart and charm, and overall it was just an amazing film full-stop from start to finish, and easily one of the best of the year.The animation is just superb here. Hardly a surprise though, as the animation was phenomenal also in Toy Storys 1 and 2, but to me it was just as sophisticated and as colourful here if not more so. I also loved the music, that said I don't think it is the best Pixar score(Up) or best score of the year, but it is almost certainly one of Randy Newman's better efforts and I liked the You've Got a Friend in Me repeat.The pacing is just fine as well, and the story is tremendously engaging with plenty of humorous, tense, exciting and genuinely affecting scenes. The ending especially resonated with my entire family, especially my brother, while the scene in the dump is for me Pixar's most intense scene.I was also delighted with the film's script. The dialogue was always witty and sharp, none of it felt forced in any way. There was the brilliantly judged humour- Buzz speaking Spanish was just one of the highlights and the beginning alone had about 5 or 6 laughs- and also the poignant parts that avoided being overly-sentimental and mawkish.Another strength is in the characters. All the main characters are as likable as ever, Woody is still determined, Buzz is a sheer delight, Jessie(though I actually like her) is more tolerable here and Mr Potato Head is hilarious. But the new characters are just as wonderful, the baby is both creepy and cute and I felt for him at the end, the cymbal monkey especially for that shriek is one of Pixar's scariest characters, Lotso looks cuddly but is actually shady and bitter with an unrelenting past and Ken is cool without being bland or annoying.As ever, the voice work is brilliant from all involved, not just from Tom Hanks and Tim Allen but also from Ned Beatty whose crusty demeanour fitted Lotso like a glove.In conclusion, a truly brilliant film and a fitting conclusion to an amazing trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox.",30 October 2023

It's the masterfully crafted sets, be it the dusty streets of Mos Eisley or the cold corridors of the Death Star, that reveal so much more about the world than the movie is telling us vocally.

",4,"I don't really care but I was appalled by how phoned in this was upon rewatching it for the first time since the theatrical release.The movie is such an egregious rehash of the second one that I had to list he similarities for my own sanity in case I was missing something, as this is so highly rated.The Lotso character is a composite of Stinky Pete and Jessie. He's literally the same exact character as Pete with the backstory of Jessie, sappy flashback and all.The same thing happens with Buzz. In 2 there's an imposter and here he is not himself, practically the same thing.In 2, the gang comes to Woody's rescue to find out he wants to stay, only for him to find out the fat country bumpkin leader is a psycho. Here, the gang wants to stay only to find out the fat country bumpkin leader is a tyrant, so Woody tries to rescue them.It starts like 2 with a fantasy intro that takes up too much time, and then you see a rehash of the original's intro in the form of home videos, I guess you didn't get by now that Andy used to play with his toys.The characters barely have anything to say and feel like caricatures. Jessie has abandonment issues and we hear her reference that almost like she's describing the screenwriter's bullet points of her character.I guess the idea is that we already know these characters well, but then why is time wasted on showing the audience all the good times Andy had with them? Isn't that implied and understood? I guess it's just nostalgic saccharine but it doesn't make me feel anything.The movie is joyless and almost nihilistic. The only reason the characters wind up in the daycare is because they refuse to believe there was a mix-up. They're just able to accept their fate like it's nothing.Seriously, Pixar wanted to do this over the Buzz Lightyear recall idea? I understand if that's not the direction they wanted, but I would've rather seen that if these were my only options.Who thought this world was worth revisiting just to be inside a crummy daycare the entire time? In the first one you see several locations and the second even more so.In hindsight, this was just foreshadowing the abominable travesty that is the fourth one. That was so bad I felt sickened and turned it off -- this is better than that -- but when I think about it, the fourth is an extension of what was started here, even recycling the same plot points such as Lotso being stranded on a vacation.This plays like a remix of every idea that was already used in the previous two.

",9,"Charlie Chaplin's previous two films, 'City Lights' and 'Modern Times', were his two absolute best films, trying as he was to prove that silent films still had a place in the all-talkie world. The quality of those films probably had something to do with this mission to prove something, for by the time he finally surrendered to sound with 'The Great Dictator', he turned completely to politics and things were not quite the same, though the film is still a sub-masterpiece, maybe his fifth best film.It's not the first Hitler comedy (the Three Stooges of all people beat Chaplin to the punch by less than a year), but by explicitly drawing attention to the duality of Hitler and the Chaplin persona, it's the most consistently funny. The globe scene alone is the best Nazi parody ever put to film, even better for the fact that the Nazis were growing in power at the time it was put out.My main caveat with the film would be Chaplin's extended speech at the end.It's visually dull: the camera stays centered on Chaplin's face as he delivers a grandiose political lecture straight to the audience, talking about peace, democracy, etc etc. It's surreal seeing all this egalitarian stuff coursing from the mouth of a Hitler look-alike, but is probably a good example of why directors such as Welles and Kubrick would later criticize Chaplin as director. Did he not trust the satirical content by itself and so saw fit to cap it off with what is essentially a 4-minute sermon? Even if people at the time 'needed' to hear such things, it's not very original now at all. For someone who had held out against the 'talkie' tidal wave for so long with such great results, it's disappointing that Chaplin would end up abusing dialog in this way right off the bat.It gives a taste of the didactic material he would incorporate into later films ('Monsieur Verdoux' had Chaplin's serial killer character justify his murders by grandiosely comparing himself to war heroes, and for all I could tell the director actually believed it) as well as giving a hint at the preachy tone many modern comedies would eventually take on.

",7,"Written, produced, directed, and headlined by Charlie Chaplin, The Great Dictator (1940) is a satirical comedy, filled with audacious and controversial social and political commentary. Set during the beginning of World War II, and loosely based on Hitler's rule over Germany, Chaplin's first ever talking film certainly isn't his first political satire but is arguably the most conspicuous of all his films.The Great Dictator relays a story akin to the cruel and unjust treatment of the Jews under Hitler's rule through two different characters methodically described right out of the gate as having a strikingly resemblance: Adenoid Hynkel, the dictator of Tomania, and the Jewish Barber from the ghetto. Chaplin's performance was truly unforgettable. The fighting spirit he depicted in his performance as the Barber effectively symbolizes Chaplin's position on fighting against social injustice, and the complete and utter fool that he depicted in his performance as Hynkel, served as a means of cautioning the audience against the threat of authoritarian leaderships on society.A self-proclaimed ""peace-monger"", there is no doubt in my mind that Chaplin's personal experience with poverty is what ignited his passion for social justice. Chaplin paved the way for the future of political comedy: To Be or Not to Be (1942), Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964), and Do the Right Thing (1989), to name a few. The way he used his auteur status and comedic ability as the medium to boldly portray his stance against the threat imposed by Germany and the unjust treatment of the Jews and achieve meaningful social change was truly brilliant. For those who appreciate slapstick humor, classic black and white pictures, and deep meaningful symbolism, I'd recommend seeing this film.",3 October 2023

It is a comedy filled black and white drama that is set in a fictional European country that clearly resembles Nazi Germany. The film looks at important issues such as racism and politics in a funny, interesting way.Chaplin played two characters in the film, Adenoid Hynkel, a ruthless and egotistical dictator, and a nameless Jewish barber. His acting was top notch as always, using his signature energy and dramatic facial expressions. The film tells the story of the nameless barber returning to his neighborhood after spending some time in a hospital due to a head injury during World War 1. The neighborhood and country are now under the rule of the oppressive dictator Adenoid Hynkel. During Hynkel's ambitious reign, the nameless barber runs into a young Jewish woman named Hannah, played by Paulette Goddard, who becomes his love interest. After the dictator's big plans, that typically lead to funny mishaps, the barber is mistaken for the dictator due to their resemblance. The barber, who is impersonating the dictator, makes an important speech in which he implores humanity to reject hatred and oppression.I think the highlight here is the overall message and Chaplin himself. You can't take your eye off him during the film, and he plays the characters with his typical flair. The message is great too as obviously oppression and racism are messages that need to be talked about even more.This film is quite obviously great. Chaplin is amazing and using comedy to defuse politics is typically a genre I like quite well. I think the film is quite similar to ""Napoleon Dynamite"" in the sense that it attempts to use comedy to look at important issues. It is also quite similar to ""Do the Right Thing"" in the sense that both Chaplin and Lee take daring and courageous jumps to attempt to tackle such serious issues in their respective films.

The great Charlie Chaplin, who played the main role and also acted as a director and screenwriter, created not only a masterful comedy, but also an amazing political satire, imbued with deep social and moral reflections.Chaplin, like no one else, managed to penetrate into the essence of Hitler's regime and perfectly understand the threat that Nazism carried. In his film, he presented not only a satirical copy of the dictator, but also touched on issues of freedom, democracy, equality and human dignity. With his extraordinary vision and insight, Chaplin warned the world against tragedies that could happen (and did, the Second World War had already begun in 1939) if we were not vigilant and ready to resist evil.Chaplin perfectly fit into the role of both characters - a Jewish hairdresser and Fuhrer Adolf Hinkel. With his magnificent performance, the actor allowed the audience to understand the difference between good and evil, between true humanity and indifference. His inimitable mimic art and bodily expression created images that still cause laughter and sink into the soul.The visual performance of the film is admirable: the images and compositions of the frames, the use of light and shadows, all this serves both emphasized irony and deep philosophical intent. Chaplin boldly plays on the emotions of the viewer, showing the painful reality, but without losing hope and faith in humanity.""The Great Dictator"" is now not only a film about the past, it is also a warning about the possible future, about what can happen if we do not learn to respect and appreciate each other. Chaplin raises things that remain relevant today - the problems of inequality, political abuse and imprisonment.The movie is good.

It was an audacious effort to ridicule the frightening rise of Nazi insurgency, done in an uncannily accurate fashion by the comedic genius of Charlie Chaplin.Chaplin's witty repurposing of names, notably Goering as Herr Garbitch (garbage), Bavaria as Bacteria, and Himmler as Herring, adds an extra layer of comedic genius. The running joke with Herr Herring being unable to tighten his belt due to his girth drew consistent laughs. In fact, the characterizations are so effective, it's easy to forget they are rooted in a grim reality.Equally impressive is Chaplin's mock German peppered with nonsensical words like sauerkraut, katzenhammer, fluten, schtudel, and sprinkled with coughs. The fictional dialogue, although unintelligible, is a significant element of the film's humor.The film's slapstick comedy, including scenes such as the coin-in-the-cake incident, Chaplin tripping down the stairs, and his character getting hit by a pan, adds an old-school charm that's simply irresistible. The sequence with the unpredictable rocket that seems to be magnetically attracted to Chaplin's character also provides great laughs.Still, some gags seem a bit worn-out, such as the failed inventions and the scene where Chaplin polishes the bald man's head. But these are small foibles in an otherwise sterling comedy.Chaplin's impressions of Hitler (renamed Hynkel here) and Mussolini (Napaloni in the film), are nothing short of brilliant. The ""Italian"" dialogue of Napaloni, with phrases like ""salami!"" and ""put the carpete douane!"", is particularly hilarious, adding to the overall comic effect.This film's timing, however, gives it a resonance that stretches far beyond comedy. Released during the onset of the Second World War, it's fascinating to imagine how audiences at that time would have reacted to this raw, and often brutally honest, satirical take on the terrifying political landscape.Ultimately, ""The Great Dictator"" is an important historical artifact, a testament to the courage and insight of Chaplin, who used his comedic platform to expose the absurdity of dictatorial regimes. Through his inventive satire, he successfully portrays these leaders as ""useless infants with minority complexes,"" undermining their terror with laughter.

When Mitsuha and Taki change their bodies, they try to live their own lives normally, and at the same time they try to find out why.""I will get straight to the point without further ado, Your Name has impressed me with everything. I haven't seen such a flawless and impressive animated film in a long time. Moreover, I do not remember that any film or animation has touched on such a topic before. Or at least the romantic kind.I also want to add by the way, it's very nice to see that Japan still draws its animations by hand. Dec. So even though Disney's CGI animations are quite successful, these kind of anime always have their own style. And the drawings in this film were also very successful. It is impossible not to appreciate the great effort put forth down to the finest detail.Apart from that, the script of the film was very successful. Instead of being an ordinary youth film, Your Name has asked big questions and created a very special philosophical atmosphere. And the film has a great comedy and dramatic tone. That's a problem in most movies, you know. When people start crying after a funny scene, you'll be surprised what happens and if you break out of the story. Your Name has balanced this in a wonderful way. The movie can make you laugh whenever it wants (by the way, there are great references to Japanese culture) and it can make you emotional, especially towards the end. Dec. That's why Your Name is really a special anime. Perhaps a job that Japan has never attempted before.Were there any bad aspects of the film? As I said at the beginning of this review, I had to watch the film twice to fully understand the story. Because after the first viewing, you have a lot of questions about Japanese culture and you can't understand how some events work. That's why I strongly recommend that you watch the movie twice. In this way, you can easily notice the details that are right in front of your eyes.That's why Your Name is the perfect anime for me. The quality of the animation is incredibly successful, the main characters are very sincere, the weight of the script is very deep, and the overall result is exquisite. I don't know if you like this movie as much as I do. But it's definitely worth your time, you won't regret it. Enjoy watching.THE GOOD SIDES OF THE FILM:+ Perfect animation.+ Sincere characters.+ Wonderful balancing of comedy and drama.+ The originality of the script and the depth it carries.+ Music that sticks in your head.TOTAL SCORE: 10/10.",30 November 2023

The story manages to establish the conditions of each of the characters present very quickly. Not only can you start these stories, but you can also finish them. The main plot is developed with an air of uncertainty, of not knowing who to believe or whether what you are seeing is in fact what is happening. All you know is what the protagonist knows. You can only watch what is happening from the view of his apartment. You are like the neighbor analyzing every detail of your neighborhood.

I don't get Alfred Hitchcock's obsession with portraying women who are spoiled heiresses (I watched Rear Window and The Birds in one night and it was all a bit too much) and I felt like Grace Kelly was obnoxious here, like someone wearing diamonds to a casual Sunday brunch. Her character wasn't sympathetic to me at all, and Jimmy Stewart's was just barely....and mostly because he's Jimmy Stewart and something about him as an actor always reeked ""nice guy.""The gag about Miss Torso gets old, though I appreciated the sub-plot with Ms. Lonely Hearts and the couple who sleep out on their patio to escape the summer heat who lower their dog down to the garden in a basket.The plot is ridiculous and implausible, and the ending is predictable.

The movie is a wonder in itself, considering it came from a man who made his name for decades by playing a guy who never loses. The origin of the movie makes the pessimism of the story all the more striking, as if ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a promise that loss comes for us all.The plot, about a 31-year-old waitress who trains to fight with the guidance of a grizzled boxing manager, seems old as time, but Eastwood renders it in chiaroscuro, attaining a transcendence in its stark yet stylized naturalism. Eastwood is not a director that needs gimmicks. At no point in ""Baby"" does he try to trick the viewer into thinking that it will end in any other way than how it must. But through our care for these beat-down characters on a screen, we, as viewers, still delude ourselves into hope. It's the most honest of all filmmaking - not reliant on technique or flourish but on our human conviction that faith will be enough to carry us. Eventually, even those wings of fancy grow old, and their feathers dissolve into dust. And it's from that dust that ""Baby's"" soul is made.",19 December 2023

",4,"In the realm of Clint Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby,"" what initially appears promising gives way to a gradual descent, thanks in part to Paul Haggis' screenplay. Haggis, celebrated for his work on ""Crash,"" unfortunately carries over a penchant for characters that tend more towards caricature than nuanced, real-life portraits.Enter Frankie Dunn, Eastwood's portrayal of a curmudgeon with a heart of gold, a recurring theme in his films like ""Gran Torino"" and ""Trouble With The Curve."" Dunn's strained relationship with his adult daughter serves as a contrived backdrop, clearing the path for a connection with the scarcely believable surrogate daughter, Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank).Maggie, hailing from Ozarks' ""trailer trash,"" aspires to be a professional boxer. Yet, her life outside the gym is left largely unexplored, raising questions about the authenticity of her character. Notably absent are any friends depicted beyond the confines of the training facility.Frankie's later redemption seeks to excuse his earlier misogyny, revealed when he rejects Maggie's training request, citing a refusal to train ""girls."" The film further plunges into uncomfortable territory with misogynistic wordplay, seemingly designed to give Frankie flaws but leaving the audience cringing.While Morgan Freeman's role as narrator and assistant Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris adds depth, the plot struggles to integrate him fully. A subplot involving ""Danger"" and a bully confirms Eddie's nobility, but also feels somewhat detached from the main narrative.The film's second act delves into Maggie's ascent to the welterweight crown, adeptly choreographed but perplexing in its portrayal of the media's indifference to her meteoric rise. However, the narrative unravels in the dark moments at the end of the second act, presenting a controversial decision in a bout and a glaring inconsistency regarding Maggie's spinal injury.It is the questionable victory of Maggie's opponent, ex-prostitute German fighter Billie ""The Blue Bear"" Osterman, which adds another layer of disbelief to the story. Osterman's deployment of a clearly illegal sucker punch, which should have resulted in immediate disqualification, challenges the credibility of the boxing match outcome. Additionally, the film introduces a perplexing element as Maggie sustains the crippling spinal injury, a circumstance that contradicts the standard practice of removing corner stools from the ring during actual bouts, thus raising doubts about the realism of this critical plot point.Criticism aimed at Eastwood arises from the film's conclusion, where he endorses euthanasia, conflicting starkly with Maggie's portrayed resilience throughout her pursuit of becoming a champion. This decision, however, while understandable given her tragic injury, raises questions about the example it sets for individuals encountering similar challenges, urging them to opt for a more positive outlook instead.Eastwood's attempt to distance himself from his character's actions, coupled with his statement, ""I've gone around in movies blowing people away with a .44 Magnum. But that doesn't mean I think that's a proper thing to do,"" seems disingenuous in light of the film's anti-clerical stance. Eastwood seems to endorse freedom of choice in life-ending decisions.The film, unfortunately, leans into stereotypes, particularly in its portrayal of Maggie's low-income hillbilly family, deemed insufferably unlikable. Maggie's decision to end her life before writing a will contradicts her clear wishes, allowing her repulsive family members to claim her assets.Swank earns commendation for her performance, especially in the ring; Freeman maintains his noble persona in a limited role, and Eastwood adheres to the expected curmudgeon archetype. ""Million Dollar Baby"" struggles to reconcile its initial promise, navigating through a ring fraught with stereotypes, inconsistencies, and missed opportunities.",14 December 2023

I think if you click in to his sunny disposition as a performer (but it's a melancholic one deep down, sure, fine), then I get why this will be a much more meaningful film.As far as a ""Man Knows It's The Last Days What Can He Do"" existential sagas, what separates this from an Ikiru, or even its British counterpart Living, is those films give more time for us to see how other people consider the lead after his passing and it is a more emotional and complex portrayal, whereas this is much more straightforward and is sort of repetitive in the point that it's making about the relentless optimism and Just GO For It spirit of Anand. Not to mention, frankly, this has mostly flat 60s/70s style flat TV level lighting and except for a few moments where Mukherjee keeps the camera steady in the musical set pieces it's just competently directed at most.

",8,"There are many boxing movies. Some are about boxers moving upward (""Rocky"" 1976 - 1990), some are about boxers moving downward (""Raging bull"", 1980, Martin Scorsese) and some are about corruption in the boxing business (""Body and soul"", 1947, Robert Rossen).In all of these films the boxer is a man, so ""Million dollar baby"" (2004, Clint Eastwood) about a female boxer (Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hilary Swank) is really a bold subject. Director Clint Eastwood takes an even greater risk with the ending of the film, in which Maggie asks for euthanasia when a fight has left her paralysed. There was much criticism on this ending. It would suggest that there is no quality in the life of people with a disability. In my opinion this criticism is formulated much too general. In the film it is Maggie who judges the quality of her own life herself. It is in no way suggested that the verdict would always and necessarily be on the negative.The real strength of the film however does not lie in this bold storyline. The real strength is in the relationship that grows slowly between Maggie (a waitress dreaming of a boxing career) and Frank Dunn (played by Clint Eastwood himself). Frank Dunn owns a gym and once was a boxing trainer. He quit when a pupil of him got badly injured in a fight. It takes Maggie a lot of effort to persuade Frank to become a trainer again. Knowing Frank's past makes the ending all the more poignant.Frank has lost contact with his biological daughter and Maggie has an antisocal family.During the film there evolves a sort of father - daughter relationship between the two.This second layer of the movie makes it more or less a twin film with ""Gran Torino"" (2008) within the oeuvre of Clint Eastwood. In ""Gran Torino"" the main character (also played by Eastwood himself) has also lost contact with his family and develops a grandfather - grandson relationship with one of the boys from his neighboorhood.The family of Maggie comes from the Ozark mountains. People from these region do have a bad name in the United States. In ""Million dollar baby"" their portrayal is on the verge of a caricature. For a somewhat more nuanced portrayel see ""Winter's bone"" (2010, Debra Granik).The cinematography of the boxing scenes were a little disappointing to me, but maybe we are too spoiled after ""Raging bull"". There was however another scene in which cinematographer Tom Stern did a magic job. During a nightly car ride Frank and Maggie tell each other the stories of their lives.

rw9286935,ur2863499,tt2024544," Crisp and explosive on slavery
",8,"The film world's new super-partnership of writer/director Steve McQueen and actor Michael Fassbender cannot seem to do anything wrong. This is the third time in double as many years they have come together (after Hunger and Shame), and for the third time the result is a crisp and explosive entertainment/art combo that stirs up your gut and entices your brain, this time through an unpolished rendition of slave life on a cotton farm in the American South in the mid 19th century. The story is told through Solomon Northup, a free-born African American from New York who was kidnapped by slave-traders and auctioned off into slavery, and who later wrote his memoirs about his experiences.12 Years a Slave invokes much of the same emotion as Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained did a year ago, only without the insipid mockery. And although McQueen undoubtedly knows which strings to pull - almost too well - his attention to detail and the psychological complexity in both captors and captives justifies the at times unforgiving and overly lingering depiction of brutality and violence. McQueen obviously wants us to suffer the way his protagonist suffered, and as long as the result isn't that he rekindles anger or implies collective guilt in contemporary viewers, I'm fine with that. At any rate, his means are never ineffective or stale. Superb performances from Chiwetel Ejiofor in the title role, the aforementioned Fassbender as the sadistic slave owner, and Lupita Nyong'o as a young female slave overshadow a terribly self-conscious Brad Pitt in a somewhat anachronistic part.",27 August 2023

rw9238065,ur33162918,tt2024544," ""12 Years a Slave"" goes down in History by portraying with rawness, but without losing sensitivity, one of the most infamous periods of all time
",8,"This impressive episode, the life story of a man who for more than a decade fought with all his might to stay alive and thus regain his original status and return to his family in due condition, was only made known to a larger audience thanks to the interest of the star Brad Pitt, who, in addition to a special participation, at the end of the action, is also one of the producers of this film version of the homonymous book written by Solomon Northup himself. This fact - as well as the title also suggests - points in advance to an inevitable conclusion: regardless of what happened to him, Northup survived. Therefore, despite so many others in the same - or worse - situation than him, the big question here is to investigate what are the merits and differentials, whether in form or content, that distinguishes him from other similar plots so often explored before by cinema. Worldwide.Solomon's journey to regain his freedom is nothing short of harrowing. McQueen shows us slavery for what it is: merciless, painful and brutal. Families were separated, scars marked the bodies of slaves through the countless tortures they suffered, bodies were mutilated... among various evils, McQueen challenges not only the public itself to face that reality today ignored by many, but also asks, without fear, a question raised by the most resentful: would it be ethically correct to film slavery in such a way? With his film, McQueen throws this issue downhill and emphasizes the importance of the theme and the relevance of the need to still discuss it today.Going beyond the theme itself, ""12 Years a Slave"" is a film that highlights the very rottenness of human beings. Solomon is betrayed and deceived by those closest to him, he is the victim of tortures that don't even need whipping to make us agonize because they are so cruel (like the long shot where Solomon is placed hanging a few meters from the ground in a tree), and at a certain moment, is forced to flog the slave Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o) until she skins him. It's strong moments like this that mark 12 Years a Slave, since the goal is, in fact, to highlight the unknown limits of human beings, something McQueen does with praise.John Ridley's powerful script clearly establishes the ownership relationship between whites and blacks. Slaves are treated like merchandise, which must serve in rural activities, giving good results to their masters. Between lashes and humiliations, there is no differentiation of sex or physical capacity. They were bought to serve, otherwise they are punished. By exploring the forced reintegration of blacks into slavery, the script does not need didactic explanations about the system at the time. What is relevant for Ridley is to show the horror experienced by one among many other blacks at the time, trapped in an unfair and painful routine.To try to survive, Platt hides that he is literate, as the consequences would be worse. The idea is that, over time, he will conquer his masters and, who knows, be freed from slavery. But it's not that simple. The conflicts that appear will question Platt's resistance and the abuses suffered by him and his companions affect his subservience. The relationship he maintains with Patsey, experienced by newcomer Lupita Nyong'o, is delicate. In addition to being black, she is a woman, who submits to her master's excessive affection, but who would choose to die to find peace. Nyong'o, nominated for an Oscar for best supporting actress, has one of the most delicate and sensitive moments in the plot, as well as the cruelest of them.Chiwetel Ejifor intelligently embodies the protagonist. His vulnerabilities and his belief that time and justice will resolve that situation give the character the strength he needs. His relationship with his two main masters, played by Cumberbatch and Fassbender, are overwhelming, especially with the latter. Fassbender builds an obnoxious, ostentatious, intelligent type. The power he has in his hands, which goes far beyond the whip he carries, blinds him and even affects his wife, the estranged Mrs. Epps, strong participation of actress Sarah Paulson. Cumberbatch, on the other hand, an apparently good man who perhaps does not quite understand that slavery exceeds the meaning of existence, gives false hope that Platt can be saved. Also noteworthy is the participation of Brad Pitt, who is also a producer of the feature and may win his first Oscar, who appears in the last act as a breath of hope for Solomon.Meanwhile, newcomer Lupita Nyong'o suggests a world of pain by embodying a double dose of oppression: black and woman, the girl is doubly inferior. However, perceiving herself favored by the attraction she exerts on the ""owner"", she adopts the pragmatic position of submitting to live, resulting in a suffered performance that exposes the limits of a woman who perhaps prefers to die than just survive thanks to "" favors"" of a sadistic and unpredictable ""master"" - and one of the virtues of Fassbender's performance lies in his effort to avoid turning Epps into a caricature, since the subject really seems to believe that he is only exercising a role bestowed by the Bible and God.With an impeccable technical team, the grandiose locations are also valued for their detailed production design and superb costumes. Sean Bobbitt's photography, who collaborated with McQueen in his two previous films, ""Shame"" and ""Hunger"", plays with the limits of the screen and with tones, not always cold and not always warm. Featuring a beautiful soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, who substitutes tragedy for melancholy in its themes, 12 Years a Slave is also touching, as it brings several moments in which we accompany those suffering beings who surrender to the singing that would eventually become the beautiful blues (which, no wonder, is a word used to describe sadness).And if the strength of the script is evidenced by the strong performances, Steve McQueen's direction could not be more effective. The filmmaker elaborates a dynamic narrative, which never tires the audience. The always well-elaborated plans take as much meaning out of each situation as they can, either to thrill or to shock. McQueen does not spare the viewer the shock, being almost impossible not to share the pain that the film exudes. Highlight for the long shots that expose the irreparable situation of the protagonist tied to a tree, while the other slaves continue their routines ""without realizing it"". Absent from showing the passage of time with didacticism, through cards or a montage that would certainly become confusing, the ellipses are well punctuated and we see time pass through the wear and tear and appearance of the protagonist.Narrated in a traditional way by McQueen - who here is much more restrained and conventional than in his previous work, the disturbing ""Shame (2011)"" - we have here a film that will do well in a history class, but which lacks the filmic elements that the allow us to go beyond this initial impression. Everything happens in a rather novelistic progression, with a beginning, middle and end, without surprises or twists. The villains are all very well identified, and no one has the slightest doubt about who to ""root"". It's very black and white, which inevitably sounds disjointed in today's increasingly gray world.After being captured, Solomon is treated like an animal. Any viewer who has watched at least one episode of the classic miniseries Roots (1977) knows what to expect from then on. Our protagonist is mistreated, despised, offended, cruelly punished simply because his skin color is dark. At the first opportunity, since he is treated as a valuable commodity, he is sold to the highest bidder. Sent to a farm, he begins standard work, which seems to go beyond field activities. One or two disagreements later, he is transferred to another owner, this one, yes, the richer and more interesting kind - the insane red-haired farmer played by Michael Fassbender offers a light that the film has been distressing since its inception. The barbarities get worse, but when the worst is about to happen, a deus ex machina comes up with a providential solution under his arm. And as free as it all began; this story of evident despair and rare identification ends.In addition to being an exemplary cinematic experience, where language and aesthetics are perfectly developed, ""12 Years a Slave"" goes down in History by portraying with rawness, but without losing sensitivity, one of the most infamous periods of all time. Thus, Steve McQueen makes an obligatory film. The final scene, simply chilling, gives hope that one day the world will be less cruel and that love will solve most of our problems. The United States is a country of immense contradictions. And, precisely because of this, we see them atoning for their sins and guilt as a nation through cultural manifestations. Being the cinema the biggest and most popular of them, how can you not come across cases like this with a certain regularity? It is, in a deeper analysis, a correct report, which does justice to the report on which it is based, but which fails precisely for being satisfied with what is evident to it, limiting itself to what was within its reach, without dare to be creative. This fact, ultimately, is what differentiates genius from mediocre.",4 August 2023

Then there is the school system. With overcrowded classrooms and underprepared teachers, there is just so much to be done.

Parents get married unconsciously, give birth to children without knowing why or why, because it's supposed to be so, because they need to prolong their family line, because they need to play with someone, because... infinite because. But is there any meaning in these words?This film clearly shows the tendency that the parents' eldest son does everything possible to please them, goes out of his way, he looks like all normal children. And he is always set as an example to the younger son, who has a different mindset, a different character and a completely different purpose, and they always scold him for not being like everyone else and in general it's strange that he is the younger brother of such a brilliant older son. And they simply abandon the child to the mercy of fate.Who are the teachers? Teachers in our schools, where do they send their children? What will they be taught there? It's simple, they are taught to be ordinary and ""normal"" in every sense of the word, or they will be made fearful and insecure, they will break their psyche with their insults and humiliations and make the children's horizons narrow. This is the kind of sacrifice that parents make for their children, who do not know and do not understand the essence of things on Earth. Therefore, the film is worth watching for all families, perhaps they will understand a lot for themselves and not make such mistakes, they will reconsider their lives and the lives of their loved ones.

All the acting in the film is strong, but Williams stands out for me.I like the scenes involving Will, Chuckie and the other guys as they feel pretty realistic portrayals of young lads in working class neighbourhoods. I can identify with a fair bit of it. That's not to say they are particularly likeable characters, but they feel like real people.One of my favourite scenes involves Will attending a job interview with a certain government agency and includes a good monologue delivered well by Damon.The law of average suggests there are likely to be people with this type of ability and potential in the world that go unrealised because they receive no help or live within social constructions that make life difficult. This is the most thought-provoking aspect of the story for me.The love interest scenes are pretty good as far as these types of arcs go, but do not interest me as much as the rest of the plot. Minnie Driver is on good form, but as someone who has witnessed many relationships fail when couples get together at a young age, I find it hard to get that invested in how it will turn out.

The deep message and moral comes brightly in, and the story is showing perfectly how it is to be isolated and lonely, even if it doesn't seems too look like it at first. Even though the amazing story development and convincing acting (Especially from Matt Demon and Robin Williams) I got to say that some points let the rating down a little lower. First of all, I wished it could be shorter. Maybe a half hour or so. The plot was interesting, but some moments felt pushed in and dragged in for no reason at all. Some character conversations that they had didn't felt so important compared too the rest of the movie, and that was what I felt a letdown. The second thing I have to pick on was less developed story from the outside. Will's story is of course the most important one, but they could take a peak on some other characters or have a little side story, just too spice up things.

This movie has no reason to overdramatize simply because it's confident in these areas of strength, and deservedly so.Some themes may be difficult to understand for the less educated and especially underage - but I'm confident this movie offers something for everyone; whether it be in its witty dialogue, raunchy jokes, or sheer breadth of fascination.

The actual best picture and lead actor of 1997. Robin Williams and Matt Damon create two of the best characters ever. Affleck and Damon's script to this day amazes at how they wrote this at such a young age. Truly every American needs to watch this to understand what Coming of age really means in our society. Very few movies understand what it means to be a man better than this one. Although it is about a guy and his journey it applies to everyone on how we can overcome, grow and need great mentors and friends to become who we are meant to be. So many heart wrecking scenes and monologues that add to a heartfelt and warming story of the ages for all.The romantic story feels so accurate to how love can be, the relationship between Matt and Robin translates so well to what a father/son or mentor/apprentice is like. The psychology side of the film is also really good. The best therapy is truly conversational, relatable, and tough at times to really get through the issues at hand. This film feels very accurate to life as well as adding a fantastical journey aspect to it as well. Not only can you relate to the characters and feel like you've been on a journey or in a relationship similar to this yet you still want to be in the movie and live through the story you see.

This is a bad Hallmark TV movie.The script is bad, the acting sucks and the directing is television movie level. Someone says something ""profound"" and it zooms in. Damon gets tense and its a close up.The central concept is fine but the execution is abysmal. Scenes like Damon humiliating the guy in the bar by quoting the page is laughably stupid, the bedroom scenes are cliche, Affleck is truly awful, Damon is all over the place from good to laughable, Millie is plain bad. I've never seen so many clichés in one movie. The dialogue wouldn't pass a Decent high school English class. Just put the subtitles on and read when people argue.

rw9511148,ur41154263,tt0054215," Psychoanalysis: Peek Beyond the Curtain to Discover a Cinematic Landmark
",10,"""Well, a son is a poor substitute for a lover.""Have to bump this one up to 5 stars. After this rewatch, as part of my ongoing Hitchcock marathon, I can now confidently say that Psycho is my favorite film of the master and that it sits firmly in my top 20 films of all time. The number of memorable quotes, indelible images and iconic scenes is quite frankly insane (wink, wink), and yet, Psycho amounts to more than the sum of its exquisite parts.There really is no other film like it, from the unique way it is structured, to its visual inventiveness, and the complex psychology of it. Indeed, Psycho's bold and successful experimentation when it comes to both the arts of storytelling and filmmaking must be applauded. However, this is not just an ""important"" film, merely a piece of academia to be studied by film scholars. The reason these creative visual techniques and the revolutionary story structure are still studied after all these years is, after all, because THEY WORK. So even if you don't care about actively analyzing Hitchcock's technical and narrative innovations, Psycho will still take you on a cinematic joyride, as it is just an utterly engrossing and immensely entertaining film.The synopsis of the film: Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) embezzles 40k from a rich client at the bank where she works and subsequently goes on the run with it. This is, of course, the greatest red herring in the history of cinema. Everything that's going on with the cop following her and the used car salesman, then the storm hitting, checking in at the Bates Motel and Marion's drawn-out conversation with Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), which then seems to make her change her mind. Through this meticulous, slow build-up, Hitchcock demands our full investment in Marion's predicament, but of course, none of that matters anymore after THE SCENE.The shower scene in Psycho. Probably one of the most well-known (and most referenced) scenes in film history, and I got nothing to add. The screeching violins and the quick editing, conspiring to make every 'film cut' feel like a 'knife cut', it's just so very, very good. I can't imagine what it must have been like to see this in theaters in 1960 (which goes for the whole film really).The subsequent scene, while not as iconic and formally inventive, is just as effective in conveying some crucial story and character elements. As we see Norman methodically cleaning up the mess, his mind racing while still acting calm and collected, we realize he's been here before. In a minutes-long wordless sequence, we get to see every painstaking detail of the cover-up, up until the dissolution of the car in the swamp (another great visual moment), and it all feels oddly satisfying. On an unrelated note, I feel like Vince Gilligan must have watched that scene A LOT, because it reminded me of those extended wordless set pieces he used to create in Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul, where we just watch men at work, usually executing some complicated scheme, the intricate details of which are only slowly revealed to us.Back to Psycho. It's as if another film begins during that clean-up scene, as the story definitively shifts from Marion Crane to the film's real protagonist, Norman Bates. We realize now that we have been taken for a ride by that sly Mr. Hitchcock with the whole money theft storyline, as the true crux of the film slowly comes into focus: what is going on with Norman Bates? What about that domineering mother? What other unspeakable events have taken place in that motel and in that large gothic house towering over it? The answers are more horrifying than we could have imagined, revealed (partly) during the masterful climactic sequence, through some memorably ghoulish imagery.My only small gripe with this film upon first viewing was the part right after that, with the psychiatrist explaining everything we just saw at a rapid-fire pace, as if he was tasked with wrapping up the film in a couple of minutes. This time around, the exposition dump didn't even bother me, because A) although it still feels like a somewhat clunky bit of storytelling, I also feel the explanation is necessary to fully unpack the film's final twist and its inherent complex psychology and B) I knew what was still coming: one final high note to end the film on. And sure enough, we get that deranged voice-over as the camera slowly zooms in on Norman's/Mother's face. One final lurid image to be imprinted on the viewer's mind, with Norman's creepy face and smile superimposed on Mother's skull.Anthony Perkins' portrayal of Norman Bates is, of course, another key to the success of this film. I truly believe he gives one of the great performances of all time here. He imbues what could have been a stereotypical 'horror movie villain' with creepiness, charm, vulnerability, intelligence, loneliness and desire, all at once.Obviously, there is so much to unpack psychologically with this film, it makes your head hurt. Once Norman Bates' true nature is revealed, the murder retro-actively becomes an incredibly layered act: on a surface level, it is of course Norman killing Marion, with the act of murder possibly being a metaphor for rape (Norman is clearly shown to be attracted to Marion physically). But as explained by the psychiatrist, it is in fact Mother taking over, triggered by Norman's arousal and (sexual) desire, and it is really her who kills Marion. Finally, I felt as if it was also Norman killing Mother (again), represented by Marion, as she is also having an affair with a married man (surely this is no coincidence). I won't dive into any more of the complex psychology at play with Norman Bates, as this character is already one of the most studied subjects in 'Psychoanalysis' (pun very much intended).One could say that Psycho invented 'elevated horror' before horror itself even existed as a real genre. In addition to having a complex and layered main character, the film boasts a stunning cinematography and maintains a tense atmosphere throughout, while relying on prolific visual techniques to evoke visceral reactions from the audience. Today, that's basically what we would refer to as 'elevated horror'.In conclusion, Psycho is one of my favorite films and a landmark in the history of cinema. If Hitchcock's radical formal inventiveness alone isn't enough to ensure it of that status, consider that Psycho remains one of the most daringly creative films of the 20th century on a narrative level as well, in the way it so boldly broke the established conventions around story structure and incorporated complex psychology into a 'simple horror story'. Not to mention its 'killer twist'. Finally, add to that Bernard Herrmann's iconic score (I can't believe I almost neglected to mention the film's legendary music in this already overlong review!) and an all-time great 'horror villain' (albeit an unconventional one) performance by Anthony Perkins and you have, with Psycho, not only one of the most influential films of all time, but also a film that still holds up today as one of the best ever made.",22 December 2023
rw9480248,ur170795673,tt0054215," Fantastic in every aspect.
",10,"For starters, the storyline is amazing. The movie starts by establishing Marion and Sam's relationship, and their inability to get married due to monetary restrictions. This sets up Marion's motive to steal the $40,000 when given the chance. The whole sequence of the cop talking to her, getting suspicious, following her, and watching her buy a new car is super intense and engaging. Hitchcock makes you super invested in Marion's story, only for it to mean NOTHING after she's killed. All the little details, the new car, the money, all of it was just a distraction. The first time I watched the movie, I was left wondering ""what's next?"" after Marion was killed, as over half of the movie was left, and the main character just got killed. That's one of the things the movie did best, subverting expectations.Additionally, the performances were amazing. Anthony Perkins' portrayal of Norman Bates was particularly convincing. He does a great job luring the audience into a false sense of security. He's very likeable, making the twist of him being the killer even more surprising.The score is another thing I wanna touch on. It beautifully compliments the movie from beginning to end. Notable standouts are the prelude and the extremely iconic murder track. The impact the score has on the movie is insane, if you try to imagine some of the movie's iconic scenes without the music, you'll realize how essential it is. Bernard Herrmann and Alfred Hitchcock make a great duo.There's much more I could say about the movie, but those are just some notable aspects that I enjoyed.

rw9477875,ur173789882,tt0054215," Psycho gets better with time.
",9,"Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is universally known as one of the best horror films of all time for many reasons. The simplistic nature of the setting and characters is not something a horror fan would crave to watch in theaters today, but that is what makes this movie so iconic in the film industry. Hitchcock's low-budget black-and-white film remains a piece of the utmost importance even 63 years later.The story is quite popular but still manages to pack a punch in the horror genre today because this film throws a curveball that you do not see in movies very often, especially in 1960. About halfway through the film, Norman Bates kills the lead actress in the infamous shower scene with the screeching violins playing in the background that almost everyone has heard before. Although killing people in a horror film does not sound like a curveball, it is the fact that Hitchcock chose it to be the lead role in the movie. The beginning of the movie follows Marion Crane and develops her character. Whether the audience grows to hate her or like her in the first 45 minutes of the film, they have no choice but to be shocked when she is murdered.Psycho is popular and well-renowned for many things, but the incredible use of foreshadowing gets overlooked when people talk about this movie. For example, toward the end of the movie, Norman is seen walking up the stairs with a very feminine-like hip swing that alludes to the big twist at the conclusion of the film. When Norman is showing Marion the room she will be staying in, he also begins to act awkward when she asks about the bathroom, which hints at the murder he would later commit there.Psycho still works on the big screen. Its success lies in its ability to find horror in an earthly aspect. Dracula and Frankenstein were abstract, but Bates is a normal looking monster that reminds the audience of a person the might know in real life. Despite the chilling final voice over claiming he ""wouldn't hurt a fly"", the true horror of Hitchcock's masterpiece is that he could be anywhere, waiting for his next victim.",6 December 2023
rw9477673,ur173783862,tt0054215," An Unforgettable Ending
",8,"The film Psycho was brilliant for its time, intensifying the audience's reactions by having a strict presentation and through the characterization of Norman Bates and Marion Crane through the symbolism of taxidermy birds hanging on the wall.Alfred Hitchcock's marketing was excellent, contributing to those who saw it only to be able to watch it from beginning to end. This presentation allowed for the movie to be seen in its entirety and for those watching it to avoid distraction and not miss a single aspect of the film. If you even look down at your phone and miss part of the movie, you may become confused and even miss essential details Hitchcock didn't want the audience to miss. The best part of the film is that the ending is unpredictable. And the conclusion is quite shocking. This presentation contributed to the audience's enjoyment of the film.Hitchcock also does an excellent job of establishing the bond between each character and giving the audience insight into their relationship. The audience witnesses this when Marion Crane and Norman Bates have lunch in the parlor. During the same scene, Hitchcock is able to use birds to represent each character's motivations, from the birds hanging in the parlor to Marion's last name being Crane and her being from Phoenix.Something I wish Hitchcock had done differently is set up what happened to Norman to cause him to commit the actions he does. I wish Hitchcock had given us a better understanding of Norman's mother and their conflict to heighten the terror on the screen.I encourage you to watch the movie if you enjoy older horror movies, but be aware you might be left with many questions, but you have the ability to make your own assumptions about what happens, just as I have. And don't forget to keep an eye out for the birds hanging on the wall.",6 December 2023

Hitchcock's meticulous character development is a demonstration of his storytelling prowess.Ability to invoke fear and suspense in the audience without resorting to graphic violence is a hallmark of ""Psycho"". Instead of relying on shocking gore, he constructs tension through the unfolding events and the pervasive shroud of mystery that envelops the narrative.

",10,"I played the trumpet for a few years back in high school, and while I wasn't persistent or driven enough in playing that musical instrument to be a protagonist in a Damien Chazelle movie, I did get one piece of advice from an instructor I'll never forget.He likened playing a piece of music in front of an audience to making a chicken roll at a Subway or equivalent fast food joint. He said so long as the first bite and the last bite of a chicken roll tastes great, the customer will be satisfied, so put the fatty/skin chunks of chicken near the front and the end of the roll. The rest might be kind of dry or less juicy, but those parts of the sandwich are... I guess sandwiched between the good stuff, and the good stuff matters most (this anecdote is going somewhere, don't worry). So that's all to say that he said to focus on the opening part and the end part of a piece when playing in front of people, and the rest can - quite literally - be noise.La La Land is, of course, better than a merely good chicken sandwich. The tasty chicken chunks last longer than the first bite; the whole first half of the chicken roll is perfect. Then there are a few bites that remind me I'm eating something that's fast food; a bit simple and dry, yet still more than edible. But then there are ample skin parts saved for the end. The last few bites of the La La Land sandwich are somehow even better than that whole first half.Sorry for the non-vegan-friendly analogy/ramble, but La La Land hits the spot almost the whole way through. It's one I'd rank behind Whiplash and Babylon by a hair, but it's still fantastic.

Their performances are both charming and authentic, making it easy for audiences to invest in the love story at the heart of La La Land. Gosling's portrayal of jazz pianist Sebastian is particularly noteworthy, showcasing his dedication to the role and his ability to convey a deep passion for his craft.The musical numbers are another highlight, with vibrant choreography and memorable tunes that linger in the mind long after the credits roll. The film's opening sequence, set on a Los Angeles freeway, is a dazzling spectacle that sets the tone for the visual feast that follows. Chazelle's direction, coupled with the masterful work of the cinematographer, captures the magic of the City of Angels, transforming it into a dreamlike backdrop for the characters' aspirations.However, La La Land is not without its flaws. One notable criticism lies in the pacing of the narrative. While the film successfully immerses the audience in the world of its protagonists, there are moments when the plot seems to meander, affecting the overall momentum. The dreamy atmosphere occasionally gives way to a slower rhythm, and some viewers may find certain scenes overly indulgent, contributing to a slightly bloated runtime.Additionally, despite the film's celebration of jazz music, some aficionados might argue that La La Land oversimplifies and romanticizes the genre, overlooking its complexities and rich history. Sebastian's purist attitude towards jazz, while integral to the story, may strike a discordant note for those who appreciate a more nuanced representation of the art form.In conclusion, La La Land is undeniably a cinematic gem, with its enchanting visuals, compelling performances, and infectious musicality. Despite its minor pacing issues and simplified portrayal of jazz, the film succeeds in delivering a heartfelt and nostalgic experience that resonates with audiences. It's a modern-day musical that pays homage to the classics, and even with a few sour notes, it manages to hit most of the right chords.",4 January 2024

",9,"La La Land is a truly special movie. To me, the meaning of the movie is that sometimes to achieve our dreams we have to sacrifice some things. Whilst it is a painful journey, it is a magical journey.Mia and Sebastian were both trying to achieve their dreams as they fell in love. In the end, they went their separate ways which allowed both of them to achieve their dreams.At the end of the movie, we get to see what their life would have looked like if everything went right for them and if they had stayed together. It was beautiful but just a fairytale. We see in this alternate ""reality"" that Mia goes to Paris to shoot her movie and Sebastian follows her. In my opinion, I don't think that Mia could have lived with herself knowing that Sebastian gave up his dream for her.The final scene between Mia and Sebastian said everything about their relationship. The smile and nod. They both still love each other very much and know that they needed to be with other people in order to realise their dreams.I throughly enjoyed La La Land. The music score is wonderful. The acting was phenomenal as was the directing. The title of the movie maybe La La Land but trust me there are so many life lessons to be learnt from this incredible movie.",2 January 2024

But the weak plot shines through the long shot's infinite pairs of picture frames, and yes this plot is a total fluff piece that seems to try to salvage the spectacle with the closing ringing narrative but the poorly assigned plot crossed with the musical seems too much to swallow. If a lot of ink had been devoted to that musical element, I think it would have been a passable musical. But the director's plotting is really off-balance, and when the subject gazes into a mirror and objectifies himself, I was expecting something surreal, but instead he overstepped his bounds with such a compromised and conservative story.I love Emma Stone's work in long-take movies like Birdman, but this time the infinite extension of the camera beyond the frame doesn't tell any moving story, but rather a tired one. You can have fun, but...There's also no excuse for the fact that it seems like the director understands that cabaret formula and writes cabaret in long takes. It makes each song and dance a separate world, but interrupts the montage to make you feel sick and nauseous.The music becomes the only superhuman presence in this flick, able to transcend time and space, enter into fantasies, break the traditional language of cinema, and unfold surreally, but it all seems to be there to supplement all that modernist yellowness?

",9,"My first ever experience of a Hitchcock picture and I can already get a feel for what his style of filmmaking is like just from this one movie, as it is so modern and contemporary for the 50's & 60's era. He did an excellent job of building up suspense and tension in each and every one of the major scenes, and this was also aided by the tremendous score which took me by surprise right from the get-go. Additionally, Anthony Perkins was fantastic at portraying his character's peculiar and unpredictable self, and there were remarkable supporting showings from Martin Balsam and Simon Oakland, the latter of which had a mere one-scene cameo, but he really owned the stage in that moment. But what shot my rating up was the mind-blowing twist which I completely thought wasn't even possible given how the story had progressed.So from this, I can now finally see why Alfred Hitchcock is regarded as one of the greatest directors of all time, as Psycho (1960) highlights his modernistic approach which stands out amongst all other filmmakers of that time. And even now, more than six decades on, his films feel almost just as revolutionary as they did so long ago.",27 October 2023

In short, they have continued passive genocide as they have always done.The United Nations army has recalled 90% of its force under the pretext that 10 soldiers were killed. Despite the fact that 600 thousand people died, he did not admit that there was a genocide and only made observations. He let 1 million people die on his first day when he could have finished everything.When they came to Belgium for the first time for colonialism activities, they divided the people into groups based on their appearance only and caused them to enter each other. In other words, the number one reason for these events to happen is Belgium. As usual, the divide and rule tactic worked, 1 million people lost their lives, and western states filled their pockets.The president's plane was definitely shot down by France, causing internal confusion in the country.

The horrors of this episode could be read online for free. Hotel Rwanda based upon it is a brilliantly crafted film, in the sense that it is well suited for public viewing. The horrors and brutality is portrayed with such techniques that it could be viewed with family and relatives. In short the movie revolves around a Hutu man (Paul) who saves a thousand victims of the genocide in his hotel. The genocide was the Hutus slaughtering tutsi.The movie in actual didn't showed the reality of the genocide in its true form. This actually worked well in spreading the message that someone like Oscar Schindler did humanitarian services in Rwanda. But in reality Rwandan event was a horrendous one, filled with fear, hate and bloodbath. It still shakes my heart.About the technical aspects, Don Cheadle performance was convincing enough as a survivor. And the director very cleverly depicted him , making him the greedy Hutu as well as a good human being both at the same time. Perhaps it's because of his greediness that he survived throughout depsite his anti hutu activities. It's his evil trait that made him relatabpe to the killers in sone way. But also he was a compassionate guy. You could imagine his character as a harmless but evil traits along with his goodness which dominates his personality. A salute to that creativity. Don Cheadle did his role well and fine. His performance will never make you feel stupid, rather at best makes you feel happy, in the sense that such a character is present in the film, in the world too. The narration though fast paced, ignoring some deep human sentiments, succeeded in showing some valuable points such as Red Cross service in Rwanda and attempt of some good guys in saving humanity. The deep sentiments and tragedy, undepicted actually worked well considering the fact that its intention was to spread the message of goodness instead of evil sense. Still it succeeded to imply the horror of the event. For this purpose its a 9/10 . I liked the film as a rewatchable war based biographical movie and really impressed with the director's job.

When the master asked my disciple to attack the samurai with a wooden stick, several farmers quickly retreated. As the retreat was too natural, I had overlooked this detail in the past. However, this retreat action showed that the farmers shifted the responsibility onto the samurai (master) and did not want to bear the anger of the attacked samurai, even though they should be the main responsible person, not the master hired by them. There was also a disciple who secretly paid the farmers to buy rice, which was a gesture of gratitude. However, when the master considered that the disciple was young and did not allow him to participate in the fight, the farmers were eager for the disciple to join in. Of course, Akira Kurosawa does not have brainless black farmers. As Kikuchiyo said, although farmers are cunning and selfish, this is the character of farmers caused by the war of the samurai class.

",8,"I begin by expressing my profound admiration for the 1960s, a decade that holds a special place in my heart, particularly in the realm of cinema. The 60s witnessed monumental events, both on Earth and beyond, and two instances that stand out are Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin's historic walk on the Moon during the Cold War-era Space Race and the groundbreaking contributions of filmmaker Billy Wilder.Drawing a parallel between these significant milestones, I find a compelling analogy between Wilder's film ""The Apartment"" and Armstrong's first steps on the lunar surface. In the world of cinema, ""The Apartment"" marked a revolutionary moment for Wilder, akin to Armstrong's historic lunar walk. It served as a catalyst, sparking a cinematic revolution that reverberated through subsequent works.While Wilder's filmography of the 60s includes notable works like ""One, Two, Three"" (1961), ""Irma la Douce"" (1963), and ""Kiss Me, Stupid"" (1964), it is undeniable that ""The Apartment"" was the genesis of his cinematic journey during that era. The film laid the foundation for Wilder's distinctive style and narrative prowess, setting the stage for the subsequent masterpieces that followed.",3 January 2024

",8,"The Apartment is a Billy Wilder classic which is now 63 years old but hasn't lost any of its bite. Its certainly I film I would happily watch again and again when the opportunity arises.The outline of the story is we have a low level worker who has ended up in the position of lending his flat out some evenings to the higher ups so they can entertain their bits on the side in the hope it will further his career ambitions.The problem with this movie for some are easy to spot as it uncovers aspects of female nature which aren't very flattering.What we get to see is woman after woman throwing themselves at the not very nice workplace boss, who each of these women know is married with kids. The fact that he doesn't treat them very well but they still want him speaks volumes. They want him because of his power and position in the company, which obviously means they aren't there because of his personality. Some negative commenters have suggested this is a sexist movie, however this trope was true then as it is now. Women will chase a man with clout regardless of his character or how it affects other women or their kids. Its ambition. And that is the other problem some have with this movie, they criticise the male lead because he is apparently ambitious, yet they fail to make the connection that the women trying to snare the boss are equally so. The women deciding to have affairs with the married male management are not stupid as their goal is to break up the marriage for their own selfish needs. So its rather rich for those with a feminist bent to try and criticise this movie for the men who are only taking what is thrown their way. The other thing that seems to irk this demographic is that in the main these men have no intention of leaving their wives for these affairs, even if they lead them on to think they will. Philanderers they may be but they have standards.The other criticism seems to be that this is not a funny film. Its not supposed to be a laugh out loud comedy, more that it has some lighter moments. Its not supposed to be the same in tone as Some Like It Hot. Its odd that people have criticised the fact that the female lead attempts suicide over an affair, which this was and still is very common, its also not supposed to be funny so its a bit strange people complaining the suicide attempt wasn't funny or asking why its in a so called comedy. This is an adult comedy its not supposed to be slapstick.Its seems that in the years since this movie was released some people have attempted to rewrite the rules in terms of the dating game but some things remain the same. Whether you enjoy this movie will come down to your attitude towards gender dynamics and whether you think women and men should be responsible for the decisions they make in life.",21 November 2023
rw9471503,ur130729929,tt0047478," 5.8/10 - Impressive, But Doesn's Justify its Length
",5,"You know, even though I consider myself a rather big film nerd, I can't say that I've seen much when it comes to Japanese cinema. I mean, I've seen my fair share of anime, sure, but when it comes to non-animated stuff I could count the number of Japanese movies I've seen on one hand. Even so, I know who Akira Kurosowa is. If Hayao Miyazaki is the best known Japanese animation director, then Kurosowa is the best known director of Japanese live-action films. I've only watched one other film from him so far, High and Low, and it was pretty good, but, in my opinion, RIDICOULOUSLY overrated among film nerds. Considering the fact that Seven Samurai is even more highly regarded, and my previous experience with Kurosowa, I didn't really know what to feel or what to expect. Before watching this movie, though, a fellow film-nerd told me that Kurosowa is like a Japanese Spielberg. After watching this movie, I can say that this is pretty accurate, in the context of this film, but I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's dive into it.Seven Samurai is a 1954 Japanese film, and it follows a little village of farmers in 16th century Japan. Each year, after harvest, bandits come to the village and forcefully take most of the crop. The farmers, in a desperate measure, decide to send a few people to look for Samurai that could protect the village. The problem is that Samurai are from the highest levels of society, while the farmers are poor and can only pay with food. As the film progresses and the mission to prepare the village to defeat the bandits once and for all proceeds, we see the internal conflicts, the seemingly impossible fight that's in front of the farmers and the bloody chaos that rules in 16th century, war-infested Japan.The Spielberg comparison actually makes so much sense to me after watching this movie. Critics and film nerds alike tend to worship Spielberg, but at the end of the day he is, generally, a blockbuster director. Very accessible, very mainstream, able to dabble in different genres each time but still be adored by almost everyone with each film he releases. From my experience with Spielberg so far he tends to capture ideas that weren't really brought to the mainstream before and execute them in ways that are maybe not mind-blowing, but are definitely enough to make an impact on the mainstream - sometimes the result is pretty good, sometimes it's just okay. This is, more or less, how I feel about Seven Samurai. This movie is like the prototype, or the gen-1, or even the original, if you will, blockbuster.We'll come back to that later, but I want to touch on some other aspects of the film. First of all, it's truly well-made visually. Kurosowa is known for his masterful blocking, and though I can't say that there are many shots that made me feel something, many of them are really pleasant and well-composed. Gotta give credit when it's due. This just goes to show you that whether a film looks good is not a question of technology first, but more a question of how good is the directing, the cinematography, the composition of each scene.I really like the score, too. From the brooding, dark theme song, through the colorful music of the big city and to the careful, almost childish music in the background of the romance-related scenes. It's not crazy, but again, well-made. An aspect of this film I definitely enjoyed.I think that when talking about this film as a blockbuster, one can really appreciate the scope of this movie, considering the time in which it came out. At almost 3.5 hours, and with a really big cast of characters and grand battle scenes, this film was really ambitious. It almost made the studio go broke with how much money the production needed. Nothing can take that away from this movie, but even though it's very impressive to pull this sort of plot off in the 1950's, it doesn't make this film good. You see, there are some parts of the story that I like - cool use of tropes that later became classic, some aspects of the romance subplot, the BURNING HOUSE SCENE WITH THE GIRL WAKING UP (which is WAY too good for this movie, honestly), the way that this movie manages to make us feel the setting, the location, how it teaches us about the village's structure to make one of the more realistic battle scenes I've seen, strategically speaking. But these parts are not the main thing here, and are scattered throughout the movie. Most of it I honestly find nothing more than okay, and sometimes (like almost every scene with Kikuchiyo) it's just too stiff, too forced, too shallow. A film that establishes so many characters (that are simple but still all different) might really need this runtime, sure, it's not unheard of, but the story itself is just not that interesting. I like some parts of it, but 3.5 hours that are mostly just pretty decent to mediocre blockbuster material are just not worth it. Sorry for anyone who loves this film, but this is how I feel.Seven Samurai's scope is definitely impressive, and it has some cool, fun moments, well-composed shots and a good soundtrack. The biggest chunk of this 3.5-hour long movie, though, is somewhere between mediocre and not bad, and this just won't do in such a long film. It becomes tiresome, and along with the parts of this film that feel too over-the-top to really work, I feel like this movie is not much more than a mediocre experience. Again - it has some good, and not a lot of bad, but with such a length and not enough substance it just doesn't succeed at getting me immersed. Feeling a 5.8/10 on this one.",3 December 2023

breakout film for him, after five years of straight comedy roles. Here he has
a part that gives him the opportunity to show how deep an actor he could be.Bud Baxter is a schlub who let himself get trapped in an impossible situation,
and then, somehow, saw it all get worse. I'm not a huge fan of Shirley
MacLaine's, but this is the kind of part that she really does excel at. Very
few actresses could hit the right mix of sass and pathos that the part
requires. As for Fred MacMurray, I knew him as the dad on My Three Sons when
I was a kid. It wasn't until I watched The Caine Mutiny and Double Indemnity

I think the basis of this is as perfect of a story as it can get, but I was left utterly cold for way too much of this. Excessive in its length and populated with bland characters: I do appreciate how the samurai in question distinguish between themselves with different personality types but archetypes is frankly all they are (the most depth you can expect is 'forbidden romance' and 'troubled past'). There's also an issue I have that applies to my experience with other films from these older eras as well (which may very well just be a me-thing) where I tend to feel a lack of punctuation. Now, I'm not asking every film to be full-on Nolan and have everything try to be completely epic, in fact, I think he presents the other side of the punctuation coin in Oppenheimer with its constant blaring score and indulgent pacing -- when it's supposed to be quiet and slow down, it hardly does. It becomes a flatline of an experience. The opposite applies here: even when there's action, swords swinging, sheds burning, there's this ever-present sense of banality. Lots of instances where I numbly went ""oh, guess we're doing this now"". Maybe some of the setups got lost in translation (an announcement for a coming event)?The rating I'm giving here must seem entirely out of proportion considering how admittedly harsh I'm being on this, but as stated earlier there is still plenty to marvel at. Even by todays standards, the imagery is striking and technically it's still incredibly well put together.

",8,"Would you want to erase the memories of someone from your mind if given the choice or would you keep it and move on? What would the consequences be? This unique romantic film explores the former choice.We are introduced at the beginning of the film to a withdrawn and shy yet slightly judgemental man, Joel (played by Jim Carrey), gazing at a brightly hair-colored, boisterous and impetuous girl Clementine (played by Kate Winslet). In a romantic role-reversal, Clementine takes on the masculine role of saying something and breaking the ice, approaching them, taking the lead and introducing herself, shaking his hand, suggesting to go out somewhere, and asking him to get her number. Meanwhile, Joel plays the passive feminine role of an agreeable ""nice"" man who is forlorn and starved of love, who secretly desires her love and attention. We soon see them together as a couple in a romantic relationship. All is not as it seems however as the film explores the romantic relationship and events leading to one of them opting for a memory-erasing procedure of the other person. And events thereafter.The film does not follow a typical narrative sequence. Instead, the movie jumps around in sequence for reasons that will become clearer as the movie progresses. Furthermore, there is a parallel story line with the staff performing the procedure of erasing memories of someone's mind. Both story lines work together in tandem to move the story forward.The film reveals that a relationship with another person contains both ups and downs, highs and lows. This can include meaningful and heartfelt moments, to the playful and funny, to negative and argumentative. However, it is embracing the totality of experiences and emotions that enriches a person's life and compels them to learn from their mistakes and grow to become a better person. We see the significance of cherishing those moments that are meaningful and lovely instead of simply letting them go. As another reviewer eloquently puts it, ""It is better to have loved and lived than not to have loved at all.""This film is at times a melancholic reminiscence of times gone by, of all the little moments that make up the experience of a relationship with another person. The experience of joyful moments in sorrowful introspection. This film would appeal especially to those people who may have had similar ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend relationships which have ended.

And I don't just mean The Magnificent Seven, but also films like A Bug's Life (1998) and, in simplified form, something like Drillbit Taylor (2008).Yet this remains one of the best incarnations of what we can now call the ""Seven Samurai"" plot - in short, a bunch of poor people get tired of having their stuff stolen by marauding bandits and ""hire"" a group of seven tough guys to protect them. Sometimes only one guy is hired to protect the meek, as in Drillbit Taylor; sometimes it's just the matter of assembling the ""crack team"" to accomplish some mission that is less morally noble (Ocean's 11 (2001)), but I see this broad spectrum of productions taking a page from Kurosawa's work.Anyway, the cause is just, as you can feel the peasants' frustrations all throughout the film. The heroes are charming, very confident and seeming to have the answer to everything. Some of them, such as the wild peasant-turned samurai and the cold, calculating supersoldier can be considered iconic. And the meticulous planning of how they foil the villains is interesting.It is an action movie at heart, though, and the action scenes are duly satisfying, whether is a battle, a lynching, or simply a duel between samurai.However, the film is by no means perfect. While the team does have some memorable members, some of the members are completely forgettable and just blend in with the other characters. This is a common problem stemming from the difficulty inherent in trying to display the personality of nine or ten main protagonists in the span of a three hour film. Also as a consequence, we have some shallow and rushed motivations. The wild man was a peasant himself so wants to protect the peasants; one man has his wife stolen by the group of bandits which is why he's so eager to get back at them. When you have to many characters, their backstories of necessity become simplistic.The ending is also not satisfying at all. While the cause is a noble one, you never really get a good feel of why most of the samurai decided to risk their lives in this endeavor. Was it a love of adrenaline? Noble sentiments? Some fondness for something in their memories? It's not very well established. They just go in and do what they have to do for no apparent reward.Honourable Mentions: Mystery Men (1999).

",9,"What great direction, acting, casting, writing - honestly cannot find a flaw in this one. The comedy is so sharp, most lines will have you in complete splits. Jack Lemmon is so loveable, his eyes and his kindness shine through, he is the perfect hero and your heart will reach out for him. Fred Macmurry fits the bill as the anti hero but for me it was Shirley MacLaine who from scene 1 emerged as an absolute star. She is stunning and gives a scintillating performance. All in all - its a must watch.My top 5 highlights would be -
1. The background score - it keeps playing from the start to the end and is absolutely divine that theme music. It will ring in your ears much after you have heard it.2. The pace - from scene 1, its perfectly paced. Neither tooo fast nor two slow. It is JUST right to ensure that your attention is always ""all in"" and eyes glued to the screen
3. The scenes with the neighbours and the misunderstandings they keep having were the most hilarious for me and had me in absolute splits - every single line written was a gem - a masterclass in comedy writing
4. The entire sequence where Fran lives at Baxter's home for two days - it felt like a dream and was so well written and shot!5. That last scene before Fran leaves Sheldrake in the pub after he tells her that Baxter has quit. The 20 seconds where she reacts to him, her expressions change to confidence and a smile - what a moment.6. Loved that the ending was also so stylish. Instead of saying i love you too and ending with a kiss, he gives her a banger one liner to remember for lifetimes to come ""shut up and deal"" what a line! Speaks volumes of her personality and what a star she is (the character AND the actress) and yet its not said in a rude or arrogant way at all because her smile (smize!!) and body language automatically communicate the reciprocal i love you too and the kiss. So there is that AND the heroine being her own hero and absolutely holding her own. Truly a 50-50 here on strength of personalities and roles between the hero and the heroine. Both equally loveable not an iota of difference.Honestly, a complete masterpiece.",16 September 2023

Jack Lemmon's portrayal of the lovable yet conflicted C. C. Baxter is a masterclass in acting, blending comedy and vulnerability seamlessly. The film's exploration of office politics and personal sacrifice within the corporate world remains relevant even decades later. However, some effects and visuals might appear dated to modern audiences, as the film predates the era of advanced CGI. Cinematographically, the movie captures the urban landscape of 1960s New York with a unique flair, but the visual style might not resonate as strongly with contemporary viewers accustomed to more dynamic camera work. Despite these potential shortcomings, the film's engaging plot and character dynamics, along with its witty screenplay, keep audiences invested from start to finish, showcasing Billy Wilder's storytelling prowess.",9 September 2023
rw9271733,ur2863499,tt0053604," Instantly captivating, quintessential screwball comedy
",9,"Billy Wilder's The Apartment is a neat, clever and sensitive romantic comedy about a low-level company clerk (Lemmon) who in a bid to climb the corporate ladder lends out his apartment to his execs and their mistresses, while his own love-life is limited to exchanging cordial lines with the young and perky elevator operator (MacLaine). The assured form and a bubbly Jack Lemmon makes the film instantly captivating, as we're effectively transported back to a booming New York City in the early stages of second-wave feminism. The preface is among the best ever in this genre, and even as the plot thickens and the film turns half into a screwball comedy, Wilder keeps his composure and sense of direction. For instance, the moral implications never turn into moralizing, and we get to pass our own judgements. Wilder is more interested in exploring the
mechanisms at work than evaluate them, and this ensures that the film remains relevant even today, and also makes the Sheldrake character an interesting (if somewhat anachronistic) character study. The only thing lacking here, despite superb performances by both Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, is a little more heat and spark between them. Lemmon is a sheer delight, even if his nervous babble occasionally does threaten to overdo it a little, and MacLaine's sensitive performance is ten years ahead of its time. The Apartment won five Oscars, among others for the superb set decoration. It was the final black-and-white film to win the Best Picture Oscar until The Artist in 2011.",20 August 2023

We explore the colonial past of the country and its complicated relation with neighbor Pakistan, as well as nationalism, traditional values, and even inside racism, sexism, and misogyny. At no point does the plot feel convoluted. On the contrary, everything integrates in a logical manner, and at 149 minutes of runtime, the story doesn't feel rushed.The film's main theme is probably the negative perception of girls and women in sports by the different structures of society, not only the general population but also family and sports associations. In a ""conservative"" society women's roles are clearly established, and even those entities that are supposed to help women develop in different areas (in this case sports) would close the doors to them, no matter how talented they are.Starring Shah Rukh Khan, Chak De! India counts with great performances across the board, which is hard to pull off when sixteen of your actors are literally kids or in a best-case scenario, young adults.The original soundtrack is superb! With 7 different songs and a length of more than 30 minutes, it's clear composer Salim-Sulaiman and writer Jaideep Sahni took their jobs very seriously.Also, I never knew I needed to see 16 girls beating the living crap out of a group of men at a McDonald's, and now I can't go back!An instant favorite, Chak De!

It is steeped in violence and sickness as this man tries to figure out what happened to him. Once we realize that he was targeted specifically, things get better. Had it been random torture it would have lost its edge. If there is any charm here, it is the selection of a character with few redeeming qualities who, during imprisonment alone for fifteen years, watching television and working out, does begin to reclaim himself. Unfortunately, his past actions are now a mystery to him as he has been hypnotized and manipulated over and over. But his crimes would be unforgivable, if he knew what he was doing.

I did enjoy the characters of both Belle and the Beast although Belles choices and actions were a tad inconsistent for me. The Beast ultimately did become a loveable and likeable character in my eyes although again some of his decisions were also questionable.

The cinematography is equally impressive, with sweeping vistas and stunning landscapes that bring the story to life.But what really sets The Message apart is its message of peace and unity. The film portrays the birth of Islam as a unifying force that brings people of different races and backgrounds together. This message is more important now than ever, and The Message serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of tolerance and understanding.Overall, The Message is a timeless epic that will leave you breathless. It's a film that is as relevant today as it was when it was first released, and its message of peace and unity is one that we should all take to heart.

Meantime, ""Belle"" is living in the village trying to avoid the endless amorous attentions of local beefcake ""Gaston"". Her father is travelling through the forest when he becomes caught up in a storm and seeks shelter in the Prince's castle - but he picks a rose and is duly imprisoned. When ""Belle"" discovers he is missing and follows his horse back to the castle, she manages to get the Prince to agree to swap; they gradually get to know each other and... He has an array of servants who all shared his curse and were transmogrified along with their boss - ""Lumière"" the butler/candlestick rules the roost with ""Cogworth"", ""Madame de Garderobe"" and the wonderful ""Mrs. Potts"" (Angela Lansbury) as the teapot/housekeeper with her little ""Chip"". All of these characterisations fit the mood perfectly and as the story develops each one becomes more engaging and sympathetic to their poor inflicted master's predicament, as we build to the really quite tense, but satisfying denouement.

rw9278351,ur169025691,tt0101414," Now this is my favorite Disney film of all time when I was a kid.
",10,"Ahh yes, the nostalgia and atmosphere out of this beautiful fantastic animated feature. Me, Jacob and Liam really enjoyed quoting dialogue and songs from this fantastic classic, Beauty and the Beast. Oh, how beautiful it is, how wonderful the adventure is and how amazing the animation is. It's speechless how great this film was and it still is. Why? Because this is the first Disney animated feature to be nominated for Best Picture. I've watched from years ago and says so itself. Remember when I said in The Silence of the Lambs Beauty and the Beast is nominated for Best Picture but lost to The Silence of the Lambs. The actors and actresses won and nominated for Best Actor and Best Actress but I forgot to mention the directors for Best Director. That's Oscars worthy. When I think of Best Pictures I can rate them a 9/10 and 10/10 because THAT'S a promise to the people of all country. If they rate them a 8/10 or whatever that's fine. Much like Best Picture though I have looked upon IMDB's Top 250 films of all time but I think it haven't rated it anymore but hey I just rate them 9 and 10/10, you guys just rated them whatever you want, your opinions. Now I will talk the characters, the animation, the story and the visuals. By god! The visuals are amazing! The ballroom scene is just beyond fantastic and beautiful! People who watch this scene will heartwarmed and chilled when Mrs Potts singing Beauty and the Beast tagline ''Tale as old as Time''. The songs are catchy and wonderful. My friends Liam Fleming and Jacob Dimmock and I were singing those songs. These Belle the town song, Gaston which is my favorite, Be Our Guest, Beauty and the Beast aka Tale as old as Time and the catchiest song ever the mob song Kill the Beast. The theme song Beauty and the Beast sung by Peabo Bryson and Celine Dion it's so beautiful and so wonderful. It's just BEYOND! When I was a kid I listen to it a million times and never gets old. I talk about the others when I review this. The characters are so memorable and never forgettable, Belle is wonderful and independent, Beast is an horrifying beast who is human who had no love in his heart and the enchantress turned him into a beast, Gaston is a villian who wants Belle to be his wife, Lefou is Gaston's sidekick. Actually just looking at these two certainly looks like us. I look like Gaston with the muscles and personality and Jacob looks like Lefou cause he's a little short but yeah, Gaston and Lefou are one of my favorite characters. The side characters for example Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs Potts and Chip are funny too. I think again me and Jacob look like these two as well. I look like Lumiere and Jacob looks like Cogsworth because of his personality. And last but not least Maurice Belle's father. People always make fun of him because he's crazy because he saw the beast. That's why he's crazy just like Gaston and Lefou says but Belle thinks he's not crazy so people laugh at him and send him to the asylum. There's a scene where Maurice and his horse on the trip to the fair but got lost in the forest but Maurice makes me laugh. Actually when I was a kid the movie scare the hell out of me much like The Jungle Book though and yeah it's a kids film and it's suitable for all ages. When the beast turns back into a human and him and Belle lived happily ever after. People fell in love with the beast because you call him Beast. What's his real name? Do people just keep calling him Beast when he was turned into a human? When I was a kid I don't know his real name. Oh well. The animation is just beautiful and fantastic like I said to the ballroom scene, the animation is amazing. The animators use the animation called Traditional animation. That's means hand drawn animation and computer animation. Mix together to make the animation look amazing. Now I know what you're thinking. Traditional animation is dead. Yeah, I know that because I've watch the Animats reviews. There's a lyricist called Howard Ashman Alan Menken's friend who died years when he worked on the product. There's a disclaimer at the end of the credits saying ''TO OUR FRIEND, HOWARD, WHO GAVE A MERMAID HER VOICE AND A BEAST HIS SOUL, WE WILL BE FOREVER GREATFUL''. Wow! He really is a really good man. Anyways, that's all I can say about it. It has been a pleasure to review this wonderful Disney animated feature filled with lovable characters, beautiful animation, storytelling and directing and producing which really makes the best Disney animated feature to ever be nominated for Best Picture. The voice acting is great, the singing is great. It's just frigging fantastic! No movie collection is complete without Walt Disney Classic Beauty and the Beast. Be Our Guest and enjoy this wonderful and beautiful entertainment with your friends and families. This is one my favorite Disney animated classics of all time.

rw9206092,ur77011321,tt0101414," My favorite Disney flick as a kid
",10,"Beauty and the Beast is more than just a Disney classic that I have fond memories of. As I previously mentioned in my Aladdin review, Beauty and the Beast was my #1 favorite Disney animated movie when I was younger, and for many reasons.First of all, the story is ravishing. Beyond one miniscule plot hole (it's mentioned in the prologue narration that the last petal on the rose would fall when the Beast turned 21, and then it's mentioned later on that 10 years had gone by, so that would mean the Prince was 11 when he was cursed), this fairy tale story of a selfish Prince, cursed as a Beast (voiced by Robby Benson), who must learn to love and, in return, earn the love of a beautiful young woman, appropriately named Belle (Paige O'Hara), is a magnificent and well-executed premise. One that'll enchant you, enthrall you, even as an adult!Likewise, the animation is spectacular beyond belief that I can barely describe it! The backgrounds are so lush and breathtakingly gorgeous. Every set piece, from the beautiful French countryside, to every massive, extravagant room in the Beast's castle, is, what the French call, magnifique. And every character is designed to perfection. Belle is very fitting to her name, on account of her exotic and mesmerizing, well, beauty. Even the Beast is very handsome, even in his Beast form. What the heck, literally, EVERYBODY in this movie looks amazing, especially the Beast's servants, namely Lumiere the French-accented candelabra (Jerry Orbach), Cogsworth the British-accented mantel clock (David Ogden Stiers), Mrs. Potts the teapot (Angela Lansbury) and even her cute son, Chip the teacup (Bradley Pierce)! And every little character movement is smooth and ripe with expression. Not to mention, there's lots of shading in every character, that gives the perfect three-dimensional feel, and it really blends with the backgrounds and other effects animation. But the most visually breathtaking sequence in the movie is the iconic ballroom dance between Belle and the Beast! The character models blend so perfectly with the CGI-rendered ballroom and the dynamic camera moves. Probably the single best use of Disney's CAPS system.And the characters, pretty much all of them, are great on so many levels! Belle is kind, polite, strong-willed, free-spirited, and very no-nonsense, and unsatisfied with her routine life. The Beast is initially flawed, ill-tempered, mean and nearly unlikeable, but he gradually learns to control his temper, and as a result, Belle learns to look beyond his monstrous demeanor, and they gradually develop feelings for each other. The result is that the chemistry between the two really works. On the third side of the love triangle, we have our villain, Gaston (Richard White), a strong and handsome, but very vain and rude hunter that everyone in Belle's hometown fawns over, except Belle, who he keeps pursuing. Gaston is a FANTASTIC villain, the kind that you can't help but hate and love simultaneously. He starts as a restrained jerk jock type who constantly courts Belle and tries to get her to marry him, and gradually builds into a legitimate threat. His blindly devoted lackey, LeFou (Jesse Corti), is also very enjoyable, due to his chattiness and clumsiness. And of course, Belle's inventor father, Maurice (Rex Everhart), is very delightful, since he's a really good father, and very caring, and at times, very funny.The voice-acting is sublime, and everybody plays their characters perfectly. Paige O'Hara voices Belle beautifully, and really embraces her character. Robby Benson gives the Beast an excellent gravelly voice that matches his looks, and warms accordingly as he develops and becomes kinder. Richard White absolutely NAILS Gaston! He gives him a resonant baritone, that matches his villainous nature and muscular appearance.And along with great drama, and touching moments, the movie supplies lots of great humor when necessary. Cogsworth and Lumiere's banters are very entertaining, and the exchanges between Gaston and LeFou are very comical at times. Maurice also has his share of comical moments, like getting bonked on the head by a flying log, and also sneezing on Cogsworth.And finally, there's the music. Disney maestro Alan Menken's score is amazing and mystical. And the songs that he cowrote with the wonderful lyricist Howard Ashman (who, amazingly, wrote this movie's songs in a hospital, while AIDS ate him away) are also masterpieces, ESPECIALLY ""Be Our Guest""! But there's also the title song, sung beautifully by Angela Lansbury (may she rest in peace) as Mrs. Potts. It's very lovely.All in all, Beauty and the Beast is a true Disney classic, probably even the highlight of the Disney Renaissance, and quite deserving of its Oscar nomination. Highly recommended!!",22 July 2023
rw9001478,ur42508869,tt0074896," A careful recitation of early Muslim history
",7,"It's an epic biopic set in the early 7th century following the life of the Prophet Mohammad and the foundation of the Islam faith. Although the film is three hours long, the film never shows Mohammad, and we hear his voice only once. Thus, the story is told through the eyes of persons close to Mohammad. I watched the English-language version.At the film's beginning, we see Islam's early success as Mohammad sends messages to regional rulers. It then reverts to 610, when Mohammad was about 40 and began writing the Quran in a cave on Mount Jabal al-Nour. His condemnation of polytheism generated intense opposition in Mecca, his home, and caused some of his followers to flee to Abyssinia.Eventually, all his followers, including Mohammad, travel to Medina and settle there. We meet Hamza (Anthony Quinn), Mohammad's uncle, Bilal (Johnny Sekka), a former slave, and other future leaders. Abu Sufyan (Michael Ansara) and his wife, Hind (Irene Papas), lead the opposition to Mohammad in Mecca.The film follows the ongoing plots against Mohammad, provides the rudiments of his teaching that differed from the polytheism around him, and the battles with his opponents. A truce and Mohammad's successful attraction of many new followers led to his triumphant return to Mecca and the cleansing of the Kaaba that had previously contained the idols of many religions.""The Message"" is a careful recitation of early Muslim history. Despite this care, it did not avoid controversy and opposition from conservative Muslims. The care meant ""The Message"" contained little artistic creativity beyond lengthy marching and battle scenes, and the absence of a visible Prophet was impossible to overcome. Still, ""The Message"" is a quick introduction to the early history of Islam.",17 April 2023
rw8999770,ur6595956,tt0074896," Very well done, a bit dated at times.
",7,"The Message is a very simplistic story. It recalls the life of the prophet Muhammad from approximately 610 CE to the end of his life. It is told in the epic mold of Ben-Hur or the Ten Commandmants. Interestingly, the film follows the tenet of Islam of not displaying Muhammad, so he is never directly shown but has his followers and adversaries do all of the talking for him as stand-ins.The story is well-known to Muslims as well as various people who have studied religion. Muhammad receives the word of God from the angel Gabriel in a desert cave in Mecca. Muhammad begins to gain followers with his message of one God with he being his messenger.However, as with most prophets, this is not well regarded with the Meccan authorities. Pilgrims come to a religious shrine shaped as a cube (Ka'ba in Arabic) that was said to be a holy shrine of Abraham himself. By the 7th century however it has turned to a place full of various idols, hundreds in fact with different followers and customs. This pilgrimage is profitable to the authorities and Muhammad's religion is seen as a threat.Soon, persecution of the Muslims begin. An Abyssian slave name Bilal is an early convert on hearing of the equality of all men under Allah. He is reprimanded by his master but is rescued by being purchased and freed by Muhammad's friend Abu-Bakr. These persecutions reach a zenith when it is found authorities had brutally killed 2 converts.Some Muslims flee to Abyssia to their tolerant ChristianKing, the rest languish in the desert until Muhammad is asked to mediate a dispute for the warring tribes of Medina. Muhammad agrees on the condition the city converts to Islam.We see Medina and the Muslims start to thrive in their new home. War looms however as the Meccans confiscate all property of the exiled Muslims. War between the two sides ends in a truce with victories traded.The Meccan authorities begin to convert en-masse as the discipline, piety and virtue of the Muslims is shown throughout. The film ends with the Muslims entering the Ka'ba and smashing the various false gods.The film is interpaced many lessons, laws and dictates of the Quran. It really shows the peaceful and charitable nature of Islam. Unlike the modern Kings of Saudi Arabia or various emirs and sultans of the Persian Gulf, or their regressive interpretations of Islam. Islam teaches us to understand and lift our neighbors as they are us; clothe and feed them as we would our brother and sister. To not look up or down at our fellow man or woman but to see them as an equal under divine jurisprudence.",17 April 2023

",8,"I recently watched the restored version of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo."" The plot, which has some puzzling holes, follows John ""Scottie"" Ferguson (James Stewart) as a retired San Francisco police detective who grapples with crippling acrophobia, vertigo and guilt after a rooftop chase of a suspect results in a fellow cop's death. Scottie spends time with his ex-fiancee and best buddy, Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes in a very underrated performance), an independent, successful commercial artist who still pines for him.With little to do with his time, Scottie takes on a private eye gig to follow the gorgeous young wife of a wealthy college chum, Gavin Elster, who has suspicions about what she's doing all day long. It appears that the young, glamorous Madeleine (Kim Novak) is obsessed with her dead great-grandmother, Carlotta, who committed suicide and became an old San Francisco legend. Scottie follows Madeleine as she visits Carlotta's grave at a picturesque Spanish mission churchyard and her portrait in the museum. Naturally, Scottie falls madly in love with the ethereal, elegant and haunted Madeleine, and becomes obsessed with her, with disastrous results all around.""Vertigo"" explores mental illness, obsession and the dark, destructive side of sexual attraction. Scottie's phobias (fear of heights and fear of falling) and his vertigo are major plot elements, crippling him emotionally and cutting his career short -- in effect, emasculating him. He seems energized by his passion for Madeleine, but it actually clouds his judgment and causes him more pain.The elements that stood out for me were stylistic, especially Hitchcock's very deliberate manipulation of light and color. When Midge and Scottie visit a bookstore to ask the owner, a local historian, what he knows about Madeleine's ancestor, the lighting gradually darkens to the point where you can hardly see the three actors, then brightens again once they step outside, although at dusk. There is a famous shot of Kim Novak walking out of a hotel bathroom, perfectly dressed and coiffed, where she is bathed in eerie green light from the neon sign outside. The camera is placed from Scottie's viewpoint, and we sense that he has given himself over to his obsession and idealization of this woman. There is a wild, colorful, animated dream sequence which seems dated now, but at the time, would have been rather avant-garde.Hitchcock also made the most of the spectacular settings of 1950s San Francisco, with many of its striking landmarks (Coit Tower, Golden Gate Bridge, Muir Woods, the Palace of the Legion of Honor) as sites for important plot twists. In a film about obsession, detachment from reality and dreams, San Francisco seems like a film set dreamed up by an artist, but of course, all these places are real.The plot has some serious holes, including the characters' motivations. You would have to overlook that and simply enjoy the languid beauty of the cinematography, and the exploration of obsession and other psychological themes.Also, Stewart's age was an issue for me in this role. Stewart looks too old to be a romantic partner for Novak in this film, although I thought they made a cute, quirky couple in the comedy ""Bell, Book and Candle,"" where he was a publishing executive -- more of a worldly, attractive figure than a San Fran cop who had to take early retirement because of his fear of heights and can't even buy you drinks at the Top of the Mark. He looks old enough to be retired from the police force because, well, he was at retirement age for a cop. He and Midge talk about how they had dated in college, but Midge looks much younger than him. In fact, Bel Geddes was 14 years younger than Stewart.The films of that era often paired young actresses with established male actors old enough to be their fathers, and it doesn't always resonate with modern audiences in my opinion. In some films, it makes more sense that the ""ingenue"" would fall for a powerful, wealthy and sophisticated older man, but in other films, it just feels a bit creepy. It works better if the script actually acknowledges the age difference.",29 December 2023

Dare she reveal the devastating truth about herself?The score is delightful and really carries the movie forward, Kim Novak has no dialogue until at least three quarters of an hour has past but the music conveys as much as any words ever could.

The initial moment makes you focus on the protagonist's trauma and at all costs remind you that it is important for the narrative. After that we embark on a slightly different story, exploring layers of another character, while the script tries to develop a romance. Suddenly, everything changes when something extremely impactful occurs and brings back the whole issue of trauma seen at the beginning. After these major twists, we return to the development of the protagonist, but now in a more closed way, with him being the total focus of attention, in a way that had not yet occurred in the plot. The way the character transforms after another trauma in his life is a lesson in acting, directing and writing. All of this brings us to a grand finale to a grand narrative.

In 1630 Japan, an older stranger comes to a warlord's house to commit harakiri, an honorable suicide involving self disembowelment with a sharp blade. The head of the house tells the stranger of an earlier visitor who came to do the same thing, when in actuality the visitor was hoping to be kept on at the house as a samurai. The members of the house forced the young man to kill himself anyway. The warlord's house has its own traditions: the harakiri seekers must use their own sword to kill themselves and they must choose someone who will decapitate them as the harakiri is committed. The young visitor carried a dull sword made of bamboo, and in flashback we watch his excruciating pain as he tries to do his honorable act before finally being put out of his misery. It turns out the stranger knew the young visitor slightly. They were from the same warlord's house that was broken up earlier. The stranger readies for harakiri, and names three different men to serve as his ""second,"" the man who will remove his head at the appropriate time. What follows are many revelations as to the true relationships between the players.For a decades old film, the few instances of violence and gore here are jolting. There is much talk of honor here, and this film could serve as a parallel to Japan itself after its defeat in World War II. Should the country bow to honor and humbly accept defeat, or try to rise against its conquerors figuratively and stay proud? The black and white cinematography here is gorgeous, every frame looks like a pencil drawing. A climactic duel filmed on a windswept field is so beautiful I did not want it to end. This is the kind of film that would have suffered if shot in color. The musical score is a harsh combination of ancient instruments and dramatic percussion, resulting in spine tingling moments where only the music tells you what characters are thinking. At 134 minutes, this is dull. I mean really dull. There are just a couple of action sequences, the acting is great, but there are too many scenes of dialogue that go nowhere. Another problem: although subtitled, many of the stoic samurai warriors barely moved their lips in the scenes, resulting in confusion as to who is speaking while you read the subtitles. The story is like a good novel, but its execution is too somber and practiced. There are no light moments here, and that really adds to the tension, which comes and goes. I will recommend ""Harakiri,"" especially to Japanese film buffs, but be prepared for a film that actually seems longer than it is.",2 November 2023

",0,"Andrei Tarkovsky, in his 1966 film, ""Andrei Rublev"", recreates the spiritual struggle of a 15th century painter. While not always adhering to the facts of Rublev's life, Tarkovsky constructs a believable medieval reality. The 1960s were a decade where filmmakers innovated through the incorporation of documentary style cinematography in fictionalized stories. Globally, the French cinéma vérité movement, Britain's free film movement, and the New York School all were attempting to integrate documentary style filmmaking into narrative works(Mandusic 91). In Russia, directors and cinematographers during the ""Thaw Period"" such as Mikhail Kalatozov and Sergei Urusevskii with ""The Cranes are Flying""(1957) and Marlen Khutsiev with ""I am Twenty""(1964) had similar aims(Mandusic 90). Tarkovsky differs from his contemporaries due to the medieval setting of Andrei Rublev alongside the techniques he employs to achieve a sense of realism. While Kalatozov and Urusevskii were characterized by their handheld camerawork, Tarkovsky's camera often remains still and at a distance. This style of filmmaking, combined with on site locations, extensive prop research, and a black and white color scheme, transports the audience; blurring the lines between past and present(Mandusic 96-97). Constructing a believable medieval reality, Tarkovsky familiarizes the audience with Rublev's struggle in an intimate and immediate manner.Tarkovsky shifts stylistically with the ending of ""Andrei Rublev"". Wholly different from the ""observational documentary"" style employed with the rest of the film, Tarkosvky displays several of Rublev's icons through close up shots in full color. Tarkovsky's film, not adhering to the facts of Rublev's actual life, blends reality and fiction with these final shots. The blurring of fiction and reality is by no means unheard of in the Russian film canon. The ""Fictionalized Documentary Movement"" from the late 1940s and early 1950s, often portrayed a deified Stalin and Soviet victory through documentary style filmmaking interlaced with genuine documentary footage(Mandusic 88). While the usage of real footage is clearly different in ""Andrei Rublev"" it is nonetheless fascinating how different directors can use genuine footage within fictional accounts. Tarkovsky's usage of Rublev's artwork alongside a deviation from the style which characterizes the rest of the film is brilliant. It mythologizes the creation of the icons, tangibly connecting the film to reality, while also acting as the conclusion to Rublev's arc. The change in style suggests Rublev's icons have a transcendent quality; ungrounded in the observant-documentary style of the rest of the film.",27 November 2023

Braddock during the Great Depression and what he had to do to get by.Cinderella Man is an excellent biographical movie. This movie tells a more personal story about a less famous individual in the world. Oftentimes many biographical movies would opt to tell a story about a politician or a record setting champion. Cinderlla Man opts to tell a story about an underdog that overcomes the odds. The story is told in a compelling way that is owed to its direction, casting, and biographical nature.Cinderlla Man does incredibly well with its direction. This movie is a glimpse into the period of American history when the Great Depression gripped the country. The desperation that Americans had during this time is palpable in this movie. The set design is fantastic as it captures the spirit of old photographs taken during the 1930s.The casting is excellent in the movie. The trio of main cast members in Russell Crowe, Renee Zellweger, and Paul Giamatti do a great job in bringing the story to life. The audience can get behind James J. Braddock as an underdog and Mae Braddock's concern for him. Joe Gould is likewise an interesting character that helps James J.

Other in the supporting cast is; Renée Zellweger as Mae Braddock, Paul Giamatti as Joe Gould, Bruce McGill as James Johnston, Craig Bierko as Max Baer and Paddy Considine as Mike Wilson.The story of James J.

I love when they hire professional boxers to play the boxers in the movie, thus going up against the lead actor, with that said Crowe did all the boxing himself and suffered several concussions and cracked teeth.One criticism which didn't bother me as much during my viewing, but what I learned about afterwards is about Max Baer. Other than the perfect performance by Russell Crowe who should have been nominated at the Oscars, we have the screenplay which was actually contributed by Braddock's real children who shared insight and family letters, their help is felt throughout the film. I just love the attention to detail and accuracy, from the sets and costumes to how the filmmakers made sure the finances were accurate to the time. The film received three Academy Award nominations, including Best Supporting Actor for Giamatti. Crowe's performance earned him a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor. Let me write about a criticism before I move on to my final paragraph. The portrayal of Max Baer in this movie was decried by his son and analysts for it's depiction Baer being ruthlessly proud of having killed two opponents in the ring. Baer only killed one person, Frankie Campbell, and it haunted him for the rest of his life.Michael Rechtshaffen from The Hollywood Reporter had this to say in his review ""Ron Howard and Russell Crowe bring the Braddock story to vivid life in a superbly acted, beautifully shot, highly engaging drama that ranks as one of Howard's best efforts."" That's true! It's a terrific sports drama and a perfect biopic. The cinematography is perfect and the cooperation Salvatore Totino has with Ron Howard after all these projects they've worked on together, it's just great. The editing and musical score too needs praise. I find the direction and acting to be the best parts of the film though.

rw8964777,ur128462828,tt0060107," Andrei Rublev, the greatest piece of Russian Cinema.
",9,"Andrei Rublev, directed by Andrei Tarkovsky, is a masterpiece of Russian cinema that explores the life and work of the eponymous 15th-century icon painter. The film is a meditation on the nature of art, creativity, and spirituality, as well as a critique of Soviet society and politics during the time it was made. With its philosophical depth and stunning visuals, Andrei Rublev remains one of the greatest films in cinematic history.One of the film's primary themes is the nature of art and creativity. Tarkovsky uses Andrei Rublev's struggles to create meaningful works of art in the face of political and social upheaval to comment on the role of the artist in society. The film argues that true art is not only an expression of the artist's inner self but also a reflection of the world around them. The artist must be attuned to the society in which they live in order to create meaningful work.The film also explores the relationship between creativity and spirituality. Andrei Rublev's journey towards a deeper understanding of his own faith is inextricably linked to his artistic process. Tarkovsky argues that art and spirituality are intertwined, and that the act of creating can be a transcendent experience that connects the artist to something larger than themselves.Another central theme of the film is the tension between individualism and collectivism. Tarkovsky uses the backdrop of medieval Russia to explore the ways in which the individual is often subsumed by the collective. The scenes of Andrei Rublev's community struggling to survive in the face of political oppression and violence underscore the ways in which the individual can become lost in the larger social and political structures of their society.The film also critiques the Soviet system, particularly its treatment of artists and intellectuals. Tarkovsky's depiction of the harsh treatment of artists and intellectuals by the Soviet government speaks to the director's own experiences as a filmmaker in the Soviet Union. The film argues that creativity and individualism are often suppressed in authoritarian regimes, and that true artistic expression is only possible in a society that values the individual's voice and creativity. Besides the personal tale of Rublev, it is a striking allegory for Tarkovsky's experiences and struggles as a filmmaker.Andrei Rublev's characters are complex and multifaceted, with each representing different aspects of Russian society and culture. Andrei Rublev himself is a brooding, introspective figure, struggling to find his place in a world that is often violent and chaotic. His journey towards a deeper understanding of his faith and his art is the film's primary narrative thread.Other characters in the film, such as the jester and the bell maker, represent different aspects of medieval Russian society. The jester, for example, represents the role of entertainment and distraction in society, while the bell maker represents the importance of tradition and craftsmanship. Each character in the film serves as a commentary on the larger social and political structures of their time.The film's cinematography is a work of art in itself, with Tarkovsky using stunning visuals to create a sense of timelessness and transcendence. The long takes and slow pacing of the film are emblematic of Tarkovsky's style, allowing the viewer to become fully immersed in the world of the film. The film's use of color is also particularly noteworthy, with Tarkovsky using muted tones and earthy colors to create a sense of authenticity and historical accuracy.The film's directing also emphasizes its themes of spirituality, mysticism, and the collective unconscious of the Russian people. Tarkovsky uses the character of Andrei Rublev as a representation of the collective unconscious, a symbol of the spiritual and creative potential of the Russian people. Through Rublev's experiences, the film explores the tensions between faith and doubt, the struggle for artistic expression in a society dominated by political and religious institutions, and the role of the artist in shaping the cultural identity of a nation.The film's final scene, in which Andrei Rublev witnesses the creation of a bell, is a powerful metaphor for the transformative power of art. The bell, which is made from the collective efforts of the community, represents the possibility of beauty and unity emerging from even the most chaotic and violent circumstances. The scene speaks to Tarkovsky's belief in the redemptive power of art and its ability to connect us to something larger than ourselves. We see Tarkovsky tell the audience that he is more devoted to being an artist then being a Soviet citizen, and this is a transformative, almost Biblical scene in terms of beauty.In conclusion, Andrei Rublev is a cinematic tour de force that explores some of the most profound themes in art, spirituality, and politics. Tarkovsky's masterful direction, combined with the stunning cinematography and outstanding performances from the cast, create an unforgettable cinematic experience that demands repeated viewings.At its core, Andrei Rublev is a film about the human condition, and the struggles we all face in finding meaning and purpose in a chaotic and often cruel world. Tarkovsky's exploration of these themes is not only deeply philosophical, but also politically charged, as he uses the medieval Russian setting to comment on the Soviet system of his own time.The film's power lies in its ability to transcend its historical and cultural context to speak to universal truths about the nature of creativity, spirituality, and the human experience. It is a film that rewards patient and attentive viewing, as its themes and ideas unfold gradually over the course of its nearly three-hour runtime.Basically, Andrei Rublev is a masterpiece of world cinema, a film that stands as a testament to the power of art to connect us to something larger than ourselves. It is a film that demands our attention and our contemplation, and one that will continue to inspire and challenge viewers for generations to come.",1 April 2023

A challenge in itself given its mammoth run time of three hours, black and white cinematography (apart from the final 10 minutes or so) and the subject matter.Personally, I found the first hour or so hard going. Having no prior knowledge of the film, apart from a small peek on IMDB and the 1001 Movies Book. I suggest anybody who hasn't seen the film get a little bit of knowledge beforehand. There are plenty of sources out there.The film in a nutshell is a biographical look at the 15th century life of Russian artist Andrei Rublev. Who goes around places of worship as an iconic artist, creating works to adorn them.The 15th century Russia is shown as just as bleak and war filled as it has been up to the present day in many ways. There are scenes of Tatar invasions of Russian villages in one of the eight episodes that make up the film.Russian 'state' officials are shown taking people away who disagree with the political dictat. The film has a great deal of Christian religious symbolism which again I personally found difficult at times.It's not a film that I will revisit in all honesty but it has to be viewed at some stage in every cinephile's portfolio!",16 March 2023

",10,"Though the film was shot in black and white the pale blue eyes of Andrei Rublev stand out among the rest, betraying a stark innocence and deep clarity which make the man one of those unfortunate souls that seem to stand out of place and time. The predominant ethic of Medieval Russia was to punish people for their sins, induce atonement for their wicked deeds in order to save them from themselves. Punishments are meted out all throughout the film. The skomorokh's lyre thrown to the ground as penance for his profanity; pagans captured and beaten for practicing a love not approved by the church; Andrei's compatriots have their eyes gutted out of their heads; multiple people are crucified. Such acts of cruelty eat away at the tender heart of Andrei Rublev.Midway through film he is asked to paint the day of judgment on the walls of a newly constructed temple. The task proves impossible. His conception of Christianity is a loving, compassionate one that does not seek to change people through sword strokes and threatening gestures but through the tools of the artist, whether they be chisel and hammer or brush and canvas.The conflict between the tender-hearted artist and the vulgar realities of his era culminates in the sacking of a city, the desecration of a temple he slaved over for years. Grief-stricken, he forgoes his work, takes a vow of silence, and commits himself to a life of bare subsistence. It's only when he witnesses a young bellmaker's devotion to his craft that Andrei finds himself once again. This is perhaps one of the most powerful moments in the movie. The young boy has never worked without his late father and certainly has never a led a project of such importance. Failure would likely spell an early death for the boy, and yet he glides gracefully upon the wings of faith, moving Andrei to break his vow of silence as he holds the boy in his arms, consoling him, offering his friendship, requesting he make another act of faith, to join him in the production of one of Rublev's greatest works: the Trinity.It is in reconciliation that ""Andrei Rublev"" finds its end.",4 August 2022

But there was more. This film is based on a true story centered on the 1930s, during the worst of the Depression. Cinderella Man, James Bradock, Jimmy, or whatever you wanted to call him, was boxing in order to keep his family alive and out of the Hoovervilles located in Central Park. That is another reason why I loved this film; it has the character and feel of being a hyper-accurate version of perceived history. As a person from the audience, it really felt like I was in the 1930s while watching this film, as the accents, the cast, and the imaging and coloring felt so true to the time period. I would also like to add that I would recommend this movie to anyone. I think it showcases the Great Depression well but still serves as a good piece of friendly entertainment.

",5,"It's sort of a biopic of Andrei Rublev, the icon painter from early 15th century Russia, but focuses more on vignettes of ordinary life in the medieval era. The version I watched was the shorter three-hour film publicly released in France, not the longer 3 1/2 hour version that Soviet authorities forced Tarkovsky to edit.The prologue shows an early attempt to fly a hot air balloon. Some of the imagery is repeated in the eighth vignette.The eight vignettes primarily feature Andrei Rublev (Anatoly Solonitsyn), often with his associate monks or apprentices. The two other monks are Kirill (Ivan Lapikov) and Daniil Chyomy (Nikolai Grinko). Rublev's mentor, Theophanes the Greek (Nikolai Sergeyev), also appears in three vignettes. A jester (Rolan Bykov) appears in the first and last vignettes, and a female holy fool, Durochka (Irma Raush), appears in the last several vignettes.There is no coherent storyline, and the film covers 25 years, beginning in 1400 C. E. It starts with the three monks leaving the Andronikov Monastery and sheltering with some peasants in a storm. Then we meet Theophanes, who invites Rublev to work with him, to the dismay of Kirill and Daniil. Next, there is a discussion between Rublev and Theophanes and glimpses of a Passion Play, followed by an encounter with pagan forest people.We then see Rublev's struggles with the point of his craft, the destruction of much of his work, and his vow of silence after killing a man to protect Durochka.The last and most extended vignette (40 minutes) focuses on the construction of a bell by the son of a bellmaker. Boriska (Nikolai Burlyayev) crucially intersects with Rublev at the end, but this vignette is the most coherent in the film.An epilogue shows some of Rublev's icons in color, though the rest of the film is black and white.There were interesting scenes and a good introduction to Soviet-era cinematography, but I found much of the story disjointed and hard to follow. In truth, I had to watch it twice to get through it. It strikes me as a period piece without long-term merit.",11 May 2022

Let's start a revolution man!'It seems like everyone wants to love this movie because it was a paint by numbers reflection of a bunch of timely social issues. Mental health, depression, suicide, disillusionment, poverty, nihilism, etc. But this movie has nothing to actually say about any of them. It just threw them all into its misery stew with some slick set pieces and artsy slow-mo montages thinking they would backfill it with meaning. It just wreaks of 'this is what your generation wants to see, right?'I can see how teens would put posters of this movie up to showcase how edgy they are without having to understand or articulate how or why, but that's exactly what this movie is. Clueless, empty posturing, masquerading around as something much deeper but really being nothing.I am not one of those people to complain about a movie because I'm offended by it.

And it is how it should be: dark, deranged, demented, bleak, uncomfortable, wretched, and downright nihilistic. Moreover, with no good to counter the evil this time around, it is a full-on descent into madness and hysteria that viewers will either embrace or detest outright.Todd Phillips co-wrote and directed this standalone take on the origins of the Clown Prince of Crime. It attempts to create his psychological profile by painting a grisly portrait of an unstable mind that's hanging by a thread on the edge of insanity until it finally snaps. This latest reincarnation offers a relatively small-scale, low-budget, and grounded treatment but with hugely rewarding dividends.Phillips' direction in Joker barely scratches the surface of the eponymous psychopath's unhinged persona. However, Joaquin Phoenix's haunting and intense portrayal of the infamous madman bridges the gap and elevates the film to new heights. With its nihilistic tone, grim ambiance, sudden, brutal violence, and Hildur Guðnadóttir's haunting score, Joker can be scarier than your average horror movie. It's a chilling and plausible origin story that stands out as an insanely riveting character study, even without its comic book roots.

More character driven stories to be honest, more elsewhere or not a movie that's connected with the main universe type movie because this right here to me is a masterpiece. This is definitely a different interpretation of the Joker because if you look back, this was supposed to be Jared Leto's joker having a standalone film, but that did not work because first the carrier did not have any compelling things that he can do on his own plus DC was trying to catch up with the MCU Since the NCU was popular made a lot of money and people wouldn't stop talking about it but on this movie, this felt like a DC movie plus very inspired by Martin Scorseses King of comedy and taxi driver, but featuring the joker the reason that this my top 10 comic book movies of all time and possibly top three or top two DC movies of all time is because it's character driven and make a sympathize on the insanity and the crazy personality of the Joker because this is a good evil movie meaning that this is another protagonist movie which I like movie We are placed in a point of view of how Gotham is tearing apart itself, and how Gotham is tearing apart our own characters, and the core reason why this movie works for me because the stuff that he doing we should not be on his side throughout this whole movie he's killing he's murdering His own ""parent"" He's killing without remorse, but we don't turn on him. We still are on his side because the people around him are making him be this way.

There's almost no country that I know that has a very well working mental health program and so many tragedies happen due to the lack of policies, politics, budget cuts, byrocracy in general, incomprehension and mostly because of the lack of compassion.People tend to talk about what understanding and being open minded, but in truth, most of them just say it because they want to portray something to others. The motion that if everyone has the same opinion or shares the same values, is much more accepted then speaking out on issues that raise questions, in a respectful way. It's like the world or better yet the people in it, are so willing to become sheep and name the others wolfs, that they're not willing to see that neither should be the only option, but rather be understanding, respectful but most importantly individual.Arthur made bad choices, choices that most would most likely not even consider. Acknowledging that and putting it aside, he was insanely resilient, patient and indefatigable especially considering everything he had endured. I've seen this movie several times and from the first scene on, it's heartbreaking.

He dives deep into the psyche of the character, capturing the complexities of a man pushed to the edge by a society that has abandoned him. Phoenix's physical transformation is matched only by the intensity of his performance, making the Joker a character for the ages.Phillips deserves immense credit for his bold direction, taking the Joker into uncharted territory. The film's cinematography is stunning, with gritty and atmospheric visuals that perfectly complement the dark tone of the narrative. The use of Gotham City as a character in itself adds a layer of depth to the story, creating a world that feels both familiar and eerily unsettling.The screenplay by Phillips and Scott Silver is sharp and thought-provoking, offering a fresh perspective on the origins of one of the most iconic villains in pop culture. The narrative unfolds in a non-linear fashion, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats while unraveling the layers of Arthur Fleck's descent into madness.The supporting cast, including Robert De Niro and Zazie Beetz, deliver stellar performances that enhance the overall impact of the film. De Niro's presence adds a layer of authenticity to the story, while Beetz brings a nuanced complexity to her character.Joker is not just a superhero movie; it's a social commentary on the struggles of mental illness, societal neglect, and the consequences of a world that has lost its compassion. It challenges the audience to question the thin line between sanity and chaos, leaving a lasting impression that lingers long after the credits roll.In conclusion, Joker (2019) is a tour de force in filmmaking, with a mesmerizing performance by Joaquin Phoenix and a bold, thought-provoking narrative.

",8,"I think it's great to revisit the animations we watched as kids. To be able to experience the nostalgic feeling of that moment and to be able to experience the movie again in a smarter way probably means that we will have a very good 2 hours. Especially if the movie is really good, as opposed to just being good for us because we're kids.I think this movie is a very good example of that. It is debatable how much this movie is aimed at children. I personally didn't see it as a children's movie, I don't think any adult watching this movie is going to talk about how childish this movie is. I can understand this better when I watch the movie at my age. Even though some elements of the movie may seem simple to us as children, it actually contains really interesting events and characters. At the very beginning of the movie we are confronted with a father who has lost his wife and all but one of his children. So much so that this father can only save one of his hundreds of children (although this seems to devalue them, it makes the only child left behind very valuable) and that child is born physically disabled. Nemo, a character who is not good enough at swimming, appears this time. Although he can't fully swim because one of his fins is too small, Nemo is actually a good swimmer despite his disability. Of course, this father is very afraid that something will happen to his only child Nemo because of what he has been through and naturally he becomes a very restrictive father. This eventually leads Nemo to dislike his father. We have the blue fish, who is his father's traveling companion after the separation, and the fish in the aquarium where Nemo gets caught and falls in. The fish in this aquarium are certainly very interesting and entertaining, especially the leader. In the same way, what happens to the father in the ocean when he's looking for his son is definitely a very interesting story. Even the interestingness of these stories is handled and processed. Thanks to the writer of this script. He really did a very good job. My expectations were not very high, but I think that a cautionary tale was written. Who would have thought of intellectual vegan sharks?As usual, I can't talk about the quality of the animation because I don't know enough about it nor have I seen enough to comment on it, but nothing bothered me. The fish were also very cute. The effects were good too. Unfortunately, I don't have much to say about it. Even though the soundtrack wasn't ""How to Train Your Dragon"", it wasn't bad and I won't dislike it. In fact, I still remember a few specific ones.The dubbing of animated movies in Turkey is definitely very good. Of course, I can't make a comparison without watching the original, so I won't make a comparison. The Turkish dub is very entertaining. It seems that we are a very advanced country in animation dubbing. Especially the Dori voice actor really acted like a character.So this movie is not a movie that we like only because we watched it when we were little. It's still a rocking movie.

I have seen it several times throughout my life and I am still enjoying it like first time watching.Finding Nemo is an animation film from the Pixar animation studios from the year 2003. Pixar catched me with this film because of the brilliant characters, the messages, humor and the excellent storyline. I can't think of a better animated movie than this one and the storyline with those funny characters just catched me .The storyline is about a clownfish named Marlin, who lost his wife and about 400 eggs with his baby's because of a barracuda attack in the Great Barrier Reef. Just one egg was left after the attack. Marlin named his only left son Nemo. Nemo came to life with one injured fin and now his life begins with an overprotective father. Marlin always takes good care of his son, but Nemo is young and curious and one day while school he was swimming further out than he is supposed to. He gets captured by sea divers and transported to a fish tank in a dentist office in Sydney. Consequently Marlin tried to rescue him, but the boat was faster then him. That's where the story begins. Now Marlin is on a mission to find his son. On his away trough the big ocean he meets Dory, who accompanies him on his journey. Dory suffers from short-term memory loss, which makes her forget things in five seconds. But before coming near finding Nemo they have to survive a lot of adventures with sharks, toxic jellyfishes and a relaxed turtle.My favorite scene in this film is when Marlin wants to give up and he thinks he will never find his son, but Dory motivates him by singing ""just keep swimming, just keep swimming, just keep swimming swimming swimming"". That's such a beautiful scene with nice music that shows how important friends are and that there's always a way to your destination.Moreover there many other brilliant characters like Bruce the shark, Crush the turtle, Nigel the pelican and they are all so entertaining and funny.Finding Nemo's animation is perfect throughout the entire film. Beautiful seascapes, so colorful and the characters are looking fantastic.I would recommend this film for kids at the age of 6+ because there are some scenes that could be frightening for younger kids. For example the opening scene where a shark attacks Marlins family or a scene with a big anglerfish that chased Marlin and Dory.In summary this film is a beautiful film for kids, teenagers and parents. Especially the friendship between Marlin and Dory is so sweet and moving and the many funny characters are just making this film perfect for me. The story of finding Nemo has some really strong meanings, like the way Nemo's disability is handled but also a beautiful parent-child relationship.

Besides the amazing cinematography, the cool shots, and the realistic direction of the story, the movie has presented something quite peculiar. The movie is filled with weird actions from a weird character. The character manages to play with the lives of people without consequences and she manages to live out her weird inner self and express exactly what she wants her luck to be. She creates her own luck and her own love story, and the peculiar thing that all these days had me thinking was the fact that after all of these actions, and all of the weird ways they were executed, she accomplished something very real, she found the love that she wanted. So the irony is that the movie seems unrealistic because of the weird scenes and actions of the character, but it ends in a very real way. And that is what had me thinking about life itself. That it is okay to be a little weird, to do the things that will drive you to the direction you want to go, even though they seem peculiar and uncalled for. Life only feels weird at the moment and true as we look back. Right now if you think of what you are doing, you might find it weird. That's why we end up in routines. We do things we have already done before because they seem familiar, accepted and the weirdness in them has already faded away. Imagine the first time you washed dishes as a child, or did laundry for the first time. It felt like it wasn't something you were supposed to do. It felt a bit weird. That's what happens with all the actions we make in life. It's awkward at first but it's the only way to make them real. In the end we must do the weirdest of things to end up where we desire. Send that awkward text to end up in the arms of a person who right now seems like a stranger. Sit quietly at a bus stop that will take you to the city that you'll meet the best friends of your life.

It's not as good as the Incredibles or Ratatouille but anyone could enjoy this film and it is pure entertainment.For writing and plot, there's a lot to praise here. First of all the script was pretty clever, it came up with pretty clever ideas to get the plot going and keep it interesting despite the fact that most of the film is just 2 fishes swimming the ocean with limited interactions. The writers also did a pretty good job at the comedy department. Even though I thought this film could be a little childish at times, it got me chuckling a lot throughout the runtime so for the writing. I would say they did a pretty great job.They also juggled the emotions and messages pretty well. There was a lot of life lessons and messages throughout Dory and Marlin's adventure. Every time Marlin interacted with another character, he would have learned something important. Dory surprisingly wasn't annoying, I feel like most studios would have failed to keep her really interesting and charming but hey! Its pixar, they can do anything.I have very few nitpicks with this film, it definitely wasn't up to the same quality as the other Pixar films during the time and the CGI doesn't look the best. The middle chunk could get a bit boring sometimes and the opening was maybe a bit too dark but these are picky negatives that can be appreciated for the vastly superior amount of good things it did.Rating: 8.7/10.",13 November 2023

",8,"Finding Nemo Is not just an animated film; it's a heartwarming oceanic odyssey that captures the essence of family, friendship, and the inexorable power of the bond between parent and child. Pixar's storytelling prowess shines through in this underwater adventure, creating an enduring classic that resonates with audiences of all ages.The film centers around Marlin, a clownfish voiced by Albert Brooks, on a quest to find his son Nemo, captured by a diver and placed in a fish tank. Accompanying him on this epic journey is Dory, a forgetful but endearing regal blue tang fish voiced by Ellen DeGeneres. The duo encounters a plethora of memorable characters, from laid-back turtles to vegetarian sharks, each contributing to the film's rich tapestry.The animation is a visual feast, showcasing the breathtaking beauty and diversity of marine life. The underwater world crafted by Pixar is not just a setting but a character in itself, with vibrant coral reefs, mysterious abysses, and bustling schools of fish creating a mesmerizing backdrop for the narrative.What sets Finding Nemo apart is its ability to balance humor, adventure, and poignant moments seamlessly. The comedic brilliance of Dory's short-term memory loss adds levity to the film, while the emotional depth of Marlin's journey tugs at the heartstrings. The film cleverly incorporates life lessons about facing fears, letting go, and the importance of embracing the unknown.The voice performances are outstanding, with Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres infusing their characters with charisma and emotional resonance. The chemistry between Marlin and Dory is the beating heart of the film, evolving from reluctant companionship to a profound friendship that elevates the narrative.Thomas Newman's evocative score complements the storytelling, enhancing the emotional impact of key scenes. The musical motifs, particularly the iconic ""Nemo Egg,"" become integral to the film's emotional landscape.This movie stands as a testament to Pixar's ability to create universal stories that transcend age barriers. The film's narrative depth ensures that it resonates with both children and adults, making it a family classic that can be revisited time and again. It's not merely an animated feature; it's a heartfelt exploration of love, loss, and the unyielding spirit of familial bonds.In conclusion, it's is a cinematic treasure trove that immerses audiences in a visually stunning underwater world while delivering a narrative that tugs at the heart.

",10,"If anyone tells you that Disney animated movies are strictly for kids, offer Finding Nemo as a rebuttal. The movie came out the year that I turned 5- in fact one of my earliest memories is seeing it in theaters. I enjoyed it then, but 20 years later, I consider it to be one of the best animated movies ever made.The plot follows Marlin and Nemo, a father and son clownfish who live in the ocean within their anemone. Nemo's mother and unborn siblings were killed in a barracuda tragedy, and Nemo was the only survivor of the attack.Because of this incident, Marlin is very overprotective of Nemo, and is uneasy about him starting school. (Nemo also has one fin that smaller than the other, this is another thing that concerns Marlin.) His worst fears come true when Nemo is kidnapped by a diver, and lands in a dentist office in Sydney, Australia.Even though Marlin fears the ocean, he faces it and the creatures within- from sharks to jellyfish to friendly turtles to find him and return him safely home, with the help of Dory, a friendly but forgetful Blue Tang. And hopefully Marlin saves Nemo in time to save him from the dentist's 8-year-old niece who is cruel to fish!Finding Nemo works brilliantly on many levels. For one thing, the animation is breathtakingly gorgeous. From the blue water to the colors of the fish to the details in the dentist office (including a Buzz Lightyear toy in the waiting room), the animation is a marvel. In fact, Pixar's previous works all have animation bits that are a bit dated looking today, but Finding Nemo may be the first to hold up well even now.On that topic, film critic Roger Ebert noted in his best of 2003 episode (Nemo was his #4 pick) that he usually sits in the back of the theater to watch a movie, but to view Finding Nemo, he sat in the front to let the animation ""wash over him.""The voice cast is stellar as well, with Albert Brooks as Marlin, Ellen DeGeneres as Dory, Geoffery Rush as Nigel, Willem Dafoe as Gill, Allison Janney as Peach, Brad Garrett as Bloat, and more.My favorite aspect of Finding Nemo, apart from the animation, is the humor. Finding Nemo might be one of the funniest movies released by Disney. Most of the jokes are easy to chuckle at- like how quickly Dory can forget something.However, there are many clever jokes that you catch when you are older. Like- Nemo goes to school because a group of fish is called a ""school of fish."" Nigel is always knocking into the dentist window glass because birds can't see glass. Dory sees the whale as ""half full"" because she sees the bright side of things.When Dory and Marlin find Sydney, there is opera music heard as an angelic ""ahhhh!"" This clearly references the Sydney Opera House. There are many examples like this that either make me chuckle or laugh out loud.There are also many clever references to other classic movies- like Psycho with the famous score, Bruce the shark sharing a name with the Jaws shark, a pun on the famous line of The Shining, and a whale scene that recalls Pinocchio.On top of all of that however, Finding Nemo has a ton of heart, perhaps the most heart of any Pixar film, and debatably any Disney film in general.Marlin is very overprotective of Nemo, but his perseverance and courage to face the ocean to find him is very moving. There is a scene in which many sea creatures and birds spread the news of his odyssey to find his son, and it literally brought tears to my eyes.Marlin learns to face his fears and never give up, but he also learns to let go of his son and let him face the world too. On this level, Finding Nemo works again for adults.Nemo learns a lesson too, that he should listen to his father, even if his rules frustrate him. This is another level for the kids to admire the movie.In fact, as a Christian who hates most faith based movies, I admire Finding Nemo on a theological level- in which the story of Finding Nemo is similar to the story of The Prodigal Son- a story about a Father who loves his rebellious son regardless of his rebellion. Both Nemo and The Prodigal Son are beautiful stories of a Father's love for his son and God's love for us.But focusing on Finding Nemo as a secular film, it is a masterpiece. With its beautiful animation and story, Finding Nemo is one of Pixar's greatest films, and one of the best animated movies of all time. It's great when you are a kid, and fantastic when you are an adult.PS: I once asked my Mom what some of her all-time favorite movies are. This is one of the movies that she named. It was also my 5th grade teacher's favorite movie.",7 October 2023

What they did was take an amazing musical, and simply used cinema to make the stage come to life. They didn't try to reinvent anything, to a close observer it is clear this was originally designed for a stage (there is even an intermission), they simply used what cinema gave them to make an even better form. The settings are immersive and realistic, and it makes you feel like you are in early 20th century Russia.

rw9127700,ur1552793,tt0067093," How movies used to be.
",0,"Big productions, at one time, were seen as important social events, like plays where you had to dress up to go to a major big production that had been shot on 65mm film. Films, at that time, still showed you how to behave. They didn't show trashy behavior on the part of the protagonists.Fiddler On the Roof tells the story of turn of the century Czarist Russia, and the Jewish community living in Anatevka. We're witness to Tevye's dramas as he nurses his injured animal and tries to make ends meet with five daughters and a wife who tries to push him to be a better man with negative reinforcement psychology.Tevye imagines what it would be like if his social status or financial fortunes were more favorable, and amidst the everyday life of a traditional Jewish community comes a young man with new ideas. And so we see the change in Tevye's life and the hamlet of Anatevka.Films like this are meant to draw out our empathy, and show us a slice of life that we normally don't get to see. And since musicals were all the rage at the time Fiddler was made (originally a stage play) it was of course a musical, with a lot of song and dance numbers that are fairly impressive and on par for the time.The one aspect on the DVD's special features is seeing Norm Jewison work on location. And seeing him double talk to his actors, saying one thing and then saying something else that's essentially contradictory as he tries to direct the squabble between Lazar Wolf and Tevye. It reminds me of all the lies and other deceit I personally experienced on sets from cast and crew, and all done for the sake of keeping creative juices flowing.But, the end result is a well crafted photoplay replete with a lot of musical and dance flares and crescendos.When I saw the stage play it had been years since I saw Jewison's film. And I have to say that I remember the play getting lots of laughs, and where Jewison tried to keep the comedy in his film version, it just didn't have the same comedic timing, and I don't recall anyone laughing when I saw the film on TV.Jewison's film gives you the visuals and the dialogue, but you don't get the intimacy and familiarity you would with a stage play. And that's where the humor simply doesn't translate from play to screen. And that's typica with nearly all stage plays put up on the big screen; whether it's The Music Man or Camelot or some other project, part of the humor is being there with the cast live in front of you on stage.The payoff however is that you get richer visuals. You get animals, sets that represent the entire town of Anatevka, and just the overall spaces both inside and out that represent the community, and then some. And, you are spared the exorbitant cost of a theatre ticket and the cost of dressing up in your finest suit or slacks and tie to show that it is an occasion that requires a degree of formality.In the end Fiddler tells a tale of no matter how much tradition a community has, that geopolitical forces will come in and ruin your day, but that you will carry a portion of your traditions with you as you migrate from one area to another in an ever changing world. It happened to victims of the Roman Empire, Celtic Tribes, the natives in Japan, Africa, the Native Americans and others. In this sense Tevye's story is everyone's story who has suffered from forces beyond their control.Is it a good film> Sure, but it's not a good representation of the play simply because you don't get that live audience experience. And again you get the music, the humor, the total gist and feel from what the play intended, but that simply doesn't translate to the big screen. In the film you get a shortened version of the play that is very attractive to look at, retains the visual drama, and gives the gist of the lighter moments from the play, but not the full play experience.Like I told a friend recently, one of the happiest days of my life was when I quit working on feature films and tried for an engineering degree. Seeing Norm Jewison work on the DVD extras, specifically on the ""Norm Jewison Filmmaker"" documentary that came with the special edition, and seeing him double talk his actors and go through his manic directing style, to me, reminded me of all the ulcers I suffered as well as the lack of sleep from waking up at 4AM or 5AM so I could go to a shoot, then to school, then back for more work in the evening before coming home at ten at night. I never want to go back to that. I tried briefly a few years back, but this film and the accompanying documentary remind me of why I quit thirty some odd years ago.Still, for all that, if you want to see a hyper-reality of a fictional Czarist Russian town, then this is the film for you. If you want to see a people get forced to move after a lot of personal drama, with some song and dance numbers to celebrate the lighter moments, then this film should satisfy.Well shot, well directed, excellent art direction,, some good music, maybe see it once to get an international perspective on life.",17 June 2023

Set against a backdrop of religious intolerance, and ultimately a pogrom, this is a clever, engaging depiction of the harsh conditions endured by rural Russians in general and the Jewish community specifically. Norman Jewison contrives to reconcile sometimes quite brutal stories of religious prejudice with a defiantly gentle, joyful communal spirit in a thought-provoking and personable fashion.

A fascinating tale of obsession, of hustling, a tragic love story and a moral tale hinting that character is more essential than merely winning a game. Paul Newman as Fast Eddie and his partner Charlie, played by Myron McCormick, travel the nation hustling unsuspecting guys into wagering high sums on pool games. Fast Eddie is obsessed to meet, play and beat Minnesota Fats, perfectly cast in Jackie Gleason. Fast Eddie does meet and play Fats and big time gambler and money man Bert Gordon, George C Scott, is there to watch. Eddie wins early on in the marathon game, but gets cold and loses out in the end.In the aftermath Eddie, now broke meets Sarah Packard, Piper Laurie, and the two immediately connect. Here the story slowly changes to a love tale and slowly we see Sarah confess the truth about herself and proclaims her love for Eddie. Eddie loves Sarah, but doesn't tell her. During this time we see Eddie give the boot to his long time partner Charlie, and partners up with Bert. Bert is a dark, intense character and George C Scott wonderfully portrays this. Bert fronts the money for the games and arranges a game with a wealthy man, Findley, in Kentucky. Sarah, accompanies Eddie on his trip and she supports him. She worries Eddie is hustling her, but she loves him and encourages Eddie to move away from Bert and the pool hustling game. Eddie is obsessed and won't listen.Eddie beats Findlay and wins Bert a substantial sum and Bert tells Sarah he's taking Eddie. Poor Sarah, knows she's lost Eddie and she'll never be first in his life. She commits suicide. It's a powerful scene.Eddie is distraught learning of Sarah's death and sadly realizes she was right about Bert. In the climax of the movie there is one more showdown between Minnesota Fats and Fast Eddie. This time Eddie is determined and he holds the hot hand throughout.I love this film.

It stars some of the best actors to do ever do the job with, Paul Newman, George C. Scott, Piper Laurie and a different role for Jackie Gleason. It is likely the first movie that comes to mind when people think of a pool movie. With all that in mind, why do I not care for it?This may seem like a short attention span problem, but for most of the movie- Nothing happens. It begins with some impressive pool playing, but then follows an hour of characters wallowing in self-pity. In the characters own words, ""all we do is drink and sleep."" Paul Newman's ""Fast Eddie"", is anything but fast. The movie's pacing is pretty darn slow. Characters overreact to the extreme for simple misunderstandings. Sarah Packard (Piper Laurie) is so emotionally unstable, that when Eddie tells her that he is going out of town for the week, she has a complete meltdown. It is not a relationship that I am rooting for.There are great actors, cool pool trick shots and even a good scene. But I can't get passed the story and characters.

",9,"Pool hustler 'Fast' Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) gets involved with a ruthless 'manager', professional gambler Bert Gordon (George C.

Although Eddie's story is ultimately redemptive, much of the film is poignant and melancholy, especially the scenes with Eddie's sad, ""crippled"" alcoholic girlfriend Sarah (an excellent Piper Laurie). The pool-shooting scenes, in which the players compete in the then popular game of 'straight pool', are riveting (and I don't play) and the film revived interest in the game. Gleason, who was a skilled player, is excellent as Fats and the contrast in the first encounter between his 'dandified' and gentlemanly character and Eddie's drunk and aggressive behavior emphasises the difference between being a 'winner' and 'loser wanting to be a winner' (the hook Gordon uses to recruit Eddie). The cinematography and music are outstanding. A good film to watch in darkened room accompanied by a bottle of J. T. S. Brown bourbon.

It's only during the second half that things actually pick up. Felson's attitude gets him into more trouble, he obsessively pursues more glory and his relationship goes off the rails.

It was unexpected but delivers on a plot that delivers layers other than the draw of the pool game overall.It centers around young, handsome, brash, confident and charming Paul Newman as ""Fast"" Eddie Felson, a big time pool hustler pulling tricks across the region with his friend and business associate. When he decides he wants to cut his teeth on big fish, namely the legendary Minnesota Fats played with suave by Jackie Gleason, it sets into motion a story underlying beyond its cool pool hall exterior that hits you emotionally and has small echoes of On The Waterfront (at least to me) in its presentation. Its nice and presents a really good showcase for a young Newman to prove his acting chops to the world. A well chosen lead actor for a character he was symbolically to this movie, born to play.It has some lulls in the middle but they don't last long.

",10,"My knowledge of pool is limited, but that doesn't stop me from thinking that The Hustler is a great film. The setting, the atmosphere, the perfectly casted actors, the stillness and the patience...They're all mesmerizing qualities in this film that I found amusing. The plot revolves around Eddie Felson, an up-and-coming pool player with a half-drunk, arrogant attitude. A long pool game that lasted for more than 24 hours takes place, and indeed the scene is fairly long. I still paid full attention and was never bored, because seeing Eddie's slow progression into insanity and exhaustion is absorbing. There is also some breathtaking color grading and cinematography. A part of me didn't want that scene to end. Or the film.The game finishes, and the rest of The Hustler intertwines between pool games and the personal life of Eddie. The film shows everyday occurrences around him, who develops a romance with Sarah (Piper Laurie), with an interesting arc on her own. Now why do we need to see these moments? Because this film studies Eddie so fully, it is important that we see his transition from overconfidence to self-awareness, directly facing his own flaws and completely changing his priorities.It must be mentioned that Eddie is affectingly charming all through The Hustler. This is Paul Newman we're talking about; A natural scene-stealer who can add a touch of elegance to any behavior and emotion. It is a blessing that we see him in almost every single scene. His presence is simply enchanting.It must be hard to steal the spotlight from Newman, but Laurie, George C. Scott and Jackie Gleason nearly do so in their supporting roles (Scott as Eddie's abusive manager, Gleason as Eddie's nemesis). All the actors and technical qualities come together to shape this performance that defined Newman's career. The final 10 minutes is a lesson on how to end a film with an intense, bittersweet, yet fulfilling conclusion. After all we've seen and all the characters have experienced, it becomes so much more than a simple game of pool. It becomes the resolving of conflicts and the decision of fates.",7 May 2023

",10,"Nominated for nine Academy Awards and winner of two, THE HUSTLER galvanized a resurgence of interest in the game of billiards following its release in 1961. It also provided Paul Newman with one of his best roles, that of Fast Eddie Felson, and transformed him from just a mere star into a superstar. One of THE HUSTLER's oddest legacies is that the fictional character Minnesota Fats inspired a pool scrounger named Rudolf Wanderone to legally change his name to that of Minnesota Fats. That confusion led people to believe that the Fats of THE HUSTLER was a real person.Based on the novel by Walter Tevis, the rights to THE HUSTLER were optioned by several people including Frank Sinatra. However, no one was quite sure how to visualize how it would look until Robert Rossen expressed interest. Before entering showbiz, Rossen hustled pool for a living in New York, so Tevis' protagonist and the subject matter resonated with him.After securing a deal with Twentieth Century Fox, Rossen set about finding the right actors for the various roles. Because Sinatra was too old to play a young pool shark, Rossen asked Paul Newman, but the star's agent informed him that his client was due to reunite with Elizabeth Taylor onscreen as soon as her current film was completed. As it turned out, that film was CLEOPATRA, which dragged on and on, making her participation impossible. The good news for Rossen is that Taylor's unavailability for whatever project that was now made Newman suddenly available for THE HUSTLER.Because Newman never handled a pool cue prior to THE HUSTLER, Rossen assigned billiards champion Willie Mosconi to take the actor under his wing and teach him the rudimentaries of the game. By the time the cameras were ready to roll, it was said that Newman was good enough to compete nationally if he wanted to. Jackie Gleason, on the other hand, was an expert pool player and that was probably the main reason Rossen wanted him to play Minnesota Fats. Insofar as the remainder of the cast, George C Scott was fast making a name for himself as a powerful character actor, and he was certainly an excellent choice to bring the sinister Bert Gordon to life. Rounding out the quartet was Piper Laurie as Sarah Packard, Eddie's love interest.Prior to THE HUSTLER's opening credits, Eddie Felson and his ageing partner Charlie Burns stop in at a bar where they successfully scam the patrons during a friendly game of pool. Arriving at the Ames Billiards Academy in New York, Eddie wastes no time challenging Minnesota Fats, the finest player in the country, to a game. What transpires is a marathon twenty-five hour session that takes up almost thirty minutes of screen time, with Eddie's cockiness ~and bourbon~ doing him in.Unsure of what his next move is, Eddie takes off like a thief in the night, leaving Charlie behind at the hotel with half of whats money was left, and then he heads off to the bus depot lockers. It's at the depot where he meets Sarah Packard, who represents the proverbial ship passing in the night....or is this case, the morning.Too young to be considered a spinster, Sarah is an alcoholic would-be writer who doesn't seem to have a job, but has a steady revenue that she attributes to a mysterious sugar daddy. Despite their contrasting personalities ~or perhaps because of it~ the two end up falling in love.Dreaming of a rematch with Minnesota Fats, Eddie starts scrounging the seedy pool halls to raise the money, but his pride gets him beaten up. Oddly enough, Sarah's nursing him back to health seems to have a positive effect on her sobriety, giving her a sort of mission in life. When Eddie regains his health and his game, she slips back into the bottle again.Felson's monetary situation gets a booster shot when he's reunited with Bert Gordon, whom he first met the night of the match with Minnesota Fats. A financially wealthy but morally bankrupt gambler/promoter, Gordon has a lower ethical compass than Don King, and offers to bankroll Eddie in a series of games with high rollers, with Bert taking 75%. With his revenue prospects adding to zero, Felson can't afford to decline the opportunity. Sarah guilts him into taking her to Louisville with him, and when she and Bert Gordon eventually meet she takes an instant dislike to him. Their mutual disdain for one another will force Eddie to make the timeworn choice between love and money.In addition to being a powerful human drama, THE HUSTLER is also an excellent commentary on the American obsession with winning, or more succinctly, the perception of being a ""winner"". I'm a Green Bay Packer fan to the core, but that doesn't mean I share Vince Lombardi's ""winning isn't everything, it's the only thing ethos"". Rossen illustrates this beautifully in the last scene when Eddie tells off Gordon, saying 'You don't know what winning is, Bert, you're a loser! Because you're dead inside, and you can't live unless you make everything else dead around you!"".With THE HUSTLER, Rossen directed his strongest film since ALL THE KING'S MEN a dozen years earlier. The superbly staged billiards match alone between Eddie and Fats was worth the price of admission. Rossen had considerable help from veteran cinematographer Eugen Schufftan, a man who learned his craft back in Weimar Germany during the Expressionist period, and he brilliantly captures the seedy atmosphere of the urban pool hall. Schufftan's black & white photography would account for one of THE HUSTLER's two Oscars; the other was for the set decoration. A special mention should be made to Kenyon Hopkins' jazz/blues tinged score, which vividly complements the look.But it's the acting that truly makes THE HUSTLER what it is. Jackie Gleason is best known today for his brash, extroverted comedy ~particularly on The Honeymooners~ but Rossen manages to rein him in, and coaxes a beautifully understated dramatic performance out of the comedian. Scott is imposing as the black hearted Bert Gordon; he and Gleason were both nominated for Best Supporting Actor. Piper Laurie, also noticed by the Academy, does her finest work as the tragic Sarah.But ultimately, it's Paul Newman's triumph all the way. The immortal role of Fast Eddie Felson won him his Oscar....25 years later in the sequel THE COLOR OF MONEY. Oh well, better late than never.🔚",23 April 2023

This classic silent film chronicles the endless tricks and misdirection employed by the church to gain Joan's confession so she can be burned alive as a heretic.At nearly 100 years old this is a considerable achievement, noted for its pretty much constant close ups on Joan her persecutors, so that instead of chronicling courtroom action you instead see the pain, anguish and anger in the faces of those involved. At the centre of this is of course Renée Jeanne Falconetti as Joan, giving, in close up, a stonking performance even by today's standards. The whole drama is moving and equally frustrating as God's priests on earth slowly but surely decide she must burn.

I guess the arrival of The Beatles was the best thing in the planet that changed forever their art and culture.My complaint about The Hustler is the bad acting of a female character who is supposed to be alcoholic, but she doesn't act, talk and act like one. If you ever saw a drink lady, you would notice that the actress as faking it so bad. They should give her real alcohol.Then we have a scene when an obese guy is playing pool for 25 hours and he simply combs his hair and apparently he is clean and tidy again. The movie ignores that a person sweats, the beard grows in one day. In order to look sharp, he needed at least a shower and fresh clothes.Then the movie gets incredibly long with smoking and drinking scenes. It is like the director kept inserting fillers that don't contribute to the plot at all.And there are scenes where the protagonist and his friend are sleeping in a hotel with their everyday clothes on and on top of the bed instead of under the sheets. I don't think it is real.And a scammer like the protagonist act in very irrational ways. Normally people like him are psychopaths.

",6,"The Hustler (1) (1961) -I've never liked how cocky a person gets the moment they have a Pool cue in their hands. They have a strut and an arrogance about everything they do - how they walk, how they look, everything. It's not just the guys in Pool halls either, but friends, boys, girls, regardless, something about that table does things to people and I can't explain it. It's not an occurrence I've found with Snooker players.It's like they're showing off and strutting, while Snooker players look like they're embarrassed to be seen at all and would rather the spectators weren't even there.But it's always bugged me in the halls or bars and I've probably been guilty of it myself, although I can't play for toffee, but that might have been the reason that this film wasn't that exciting or appealing to me. It was still a fairly good film from a production point of view though.Having watched 'The Color Of Money' (1986) first, not realising that it was the sequel to this film, it was difficult not to be constantly expecting a con from any of the characters, which seemed to be all any of them did in the later film and I couldn't tell if Charlie (Myron McCormick), Eddie's friend, was in on it or not. That expectancy may have had me thinking too hard about it everything.Eddie was of course played by Paul Newman and there is no denying that he was a handsome so and so, but as yet I haven't seen a lot of diversity from his characters in the forms of 'Hud' (1963), 'Cool Hand Luke' (1967) and now this one. Credit has to be given however for his skilful delivery of each, despite them being a little bit samey.George C. Scott has never given a bad performance as far as I can tell. I certainly found him very suave and sophisticated in this one and very natural in his role.But with the introduction of Piper Laurie's character Sarah, the film went in a direction that I hadn't expected, certainly not based on what I had known from 'Color Of Money', because it didn't seem to fit with Eddie's character, but I did like the diversion from the sport element of the film.I've never really been a fan of obsessive characters. I can appreciate passion, but taking it so far and getting silly with it or putting pressure on others just frustrates me. I am by no means flawless, which is why I prefer to see films in which people strive for greater things, to give me something to aspire to, but most of these people are too flawed, which grinds my gears.Actually though, most of the bits without the pool were a tad dull, because they were so much slower. If they had been a little bit faster and maybe if they had made the film a touch shorter, I might not have drifted to the games on my phone so often, but ultimately there was something about this one that I liked. It was definitely better than it's sequel in my opinion, with Tom Cruise's passion as annoying as his shouty man that he did throughout the 80's.Not the worst film I've ever seen by a long shot and not even Paul Newman's worst, but those blue eyes, despite it being black and white, could charm anyone.562.31/1000.",7 February 2023
rw9370294,ur3270789,tt0019254," Carl Theodor Dreyer's take on the legendary 15th century French teen martyr Joan of Arc
",8,"In 1412, a young girl called Jeanne is born in Domrémy, France. Jeanne develops into a very religious sentiment, and she confesses several times a day. At the age of 13, she has her first vision and years after that, in 1428, she knows her mission is to be ridding France of the English and so sets out to meet Charles, the Dauphin. Later on , Henry VI of England proclaims himself king of France but then Joan of Arc, the peasant girl hears saints' voices telling her the Dauphin Charles claim the French throne and drive out the English . Being nineteen years old , proclaims in Bourges to Charles VII as king, after being crowned in Reims. Charles persuades Joan to proclaim herself the legendary ""Maiden of Lorraine"" and raise an army to battle the Brits . Joan of Arc acting as a divine mission defeats the English army in Orleans. But this ¨La passion de Jeanne d'Arc¨(1928) focuses on the interrogation, the conviction and the execution of the medieval French heroine and saint. On May 23, 1430, Joan of Arc, a 19-year-old maiden, fell into the hands of the Duke of Burgundy. She was sold to the English and dragged to Rouen (capital of the English possessions in France) and was brought before an ecclesiastical court. Joan is placed on trial on charges of heresy. The ecclesiastical jurists attempt to force Jeanne to recant her claims of holy visions. Lord Warwick, the governor of the city, chose the jurors from among the allies of the king of England, in order to secure by all means Joan's death sentence and have her burned in the public square. During the trial, Juana declares that she has fought the English under the inspiration of the archangel Gabriel. Furthermore, she claims that Saint Michael appeared to her with the promise of saving his soul. The court declares her guilty and sentences her to die at the stake.From the minutes of the trial found in the library of the Chamber of Deputies of Paris, Dreyer reconstructs the trial carried out against the young woman in 1431 in the city of Rouen. This is an unforgettable masterpiece in which the impeccable work of the theater actress Maria Falconetti stands out, who gives a terrific performance showing the deep profound pain, extreme suffering and sorrow that Joan of Arc suffered. The decorator Hermann Warm also stands out, along with the dressmaker and the director of photography Rudolph Maté who shortly after emigrated to the USA, achieving great successes both as a cameraman and as a movie director. The motion picture was very well directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer, This famous and classic director was born in Copenhague, Denmark. He was a prestigious writer and filmmaker, known for Gertrud (1964), Vampyr (1932), Ordet (1955) and La passion de Jeanne d'Arc(1928) .Other films about this historic character is as follows : ""Saint Joan""(1957) by Otto Preminger with Jean Seberg , Richard Widmark , Richard Todd and John Gielgud ; ""The trial of Joan of Arc"" (1962) by Robert Bresson with Florence Delay ; ""Joan of Arc"" (1954) by Roberto Rosselini with Ingrid Bergman ; ""Joan of Arc"" by Victor Fleming (1948) with Ingrid Berman , J Carrol Naish , War Bond and Jose Ferrer as Charles VII .

Directed by the lauded Danish director Carl Theodor Dryer the film is an exercise on expression and its effect on the viewer. Shot in a unique style of highlighting the actors' faces with continuous close-ups the film is quite the assault to the senses as one facial exclamation after another bombards the viewer. Lead star Maria Falconetti is the focus as she enunciates every ounce of expression on her face. Whether it be single-dripping tears, soaring joy, or yearning hope her highly dramatic acting leaves an impression as her creaking head motions and restrained emotional volatility subtly stamp their mark. Dreyer shows his lofty reputation with the consistent acting throughout with the far from aesthetic visages of the church persecutors convincingly depicting their ugly oppressiveness and Falconetti's adept immersion into the victim's parlous state. Alas, with all these attributes and novelties none of them work. The lack of perspective and the minimal, stage-like set limit the work creating a tunnel vision atmosphere of endlessly wearying tedium. I dozed off and zonked out throughout the flick ""missing"" scenes and dialogues altogether. This would have benefitted from a traditional style of filmmaking or as a short or both.

But I didn't think a silent black and white film from the 1920s would be able to stand up to a modern film. When it was over, I stood corrected, because The Passion of Joan of Arc proved to be one of the most powerful and moving films of all time.The incredible performances of Maria Falconetti (Jeanne), and every actor in the film was beyond perfect. The way they conveyed emotion through expression, and used their body language to speak volumes in this silent film, took hold of and captivated me. The camera work and settings were obviously far beyond their time. The director was truly a visionary. I completely fell in love with the film, and, for me at least, it became the pinnacle of Jeanne d'Arc's story on film.When I researched about the history of this film, it turns out we're very fortunate to have this film with us today. As It was almost lost to history.

",7,"A fitting finale for Nolan's Batman trilogy. The action, effects, editing and especially the score were excellent. Thumbing music beats out during the action, an elusive playful melody is heard when Catwoman is present. Everything fits.The film opens with a reclusive Bruce Wayne unable to move forwards with his life. When Gotham faces a new threat though Wayne decides batman must return, much to Alfred's dismay. Alfred had hoped Bruce might be able to put his alter ego to rest and find some sort of peace with himself while he still has a chance. The main focus of the film is clearly on Bruce Wayne in this film and the finishing of his character arc. In the Dark Knight, Gordon and Harvey Dent got as much focus as Batman did in parts and Batman really felt like part of a team. In the Dark Knight Rises some time is spent developing to two new allies Batman eventually acquires, Officer Blake (Jospeh Gordon-Levitt) and Selena Kyle (Anne Hathway). But the focus is much more on him and neither are capable of saving the day without him. The choice of Jospeh Gordon-Levitt gave me mixed feelings, a great performance by him, but in some of the dialogue in a scene between Blake and Bruce, Blake talks about how Bruce Wayne once visited Blake when he was just a boy, it's clear from this that Bruce Wayne is meant to be much older than Blake who is constantly called 'Rookie,' 'Hot Head' and 'Son'. The problem with this is that Gordon Levitt was 31 when this was made, hardly a youngster, and only a few years younger than Christian Bale. Batman does not appear until quite a bit into the film, which i was fine with as it builds up the tension. Several short, well shot action sequences do happen however to keep the audience engaged.At least 5 Villains show up in the Dark Knight Rises, Bane, Catwoman, Scarecrow, John Daggett & Talia al Ghul. This does slightly clutter the story, although it is at least well handled, unlike Spider-man 3 all the villains are written into the story from the beginning. Bane was the perfect choice I think for this film, and presents Batman with his most difficult physical challenge to date as a ferocious fighter of huge strength. Batman's first encounter with Bane does not end well and Bane is left free to reek havoc across the city with even the police taken out of the equation. With the clock ticking Batman must recover and return for one final showdown.",27 December 2023

thank goodness that WB and Christopher Nolan decided to not stretch this film series to 10 + number of films, and decided to ultimately the the beginning middle end trilogy structure.The movie takes elements from some of The most famous Batman Comic storylines such as Knightfall, no man's Land, and Even, Frank miller's the Dark Knight Returns.Christian bale gives a great final performance as the aging Bruce Wayne. Eight years after the fall and murder of Harvey dent which he decided to volunarily take the blame for to protect dent's image, he had retired from Batman now that Gotham has become peaceful. However he is still depressed because of the death of his love interest Rachel Dawes and his plan to be together with her went up in smoke. He must now deal with new enemy, Bane and must unretire and become the dark knight again. I loved how bale portrayed Bruce Wayne's pain and aging wisdom, while also trying to find personal redemption after the events of the dark knightTim Hardy IS Bane. A new villian, who was once part of the old group that Bruce trained with, the league of shadows. Bane had also formed his own band of militia mercenaries to enact his plan to destroy Gotham as his mentor, Ra's Al Ghul had intended, to ""cleanse"" the evil and corruption from it. I love his mask, and the fact that he is strong and intelligent. Also he breaks Batman first!I loved Marion Voltaire as Bruce's new love interest, business woman Miranda Tate. However she is not who she really claims to be...Spoiler: I had a feeeling she was going to be revealed as new Legue of shadows Leader...Talia Al Ghul, that daughter of Bruce's teacher, Ra's Al Ghul. Great twist. Though her reveal was short.Anne Hathaway was great as the latest to portray the anti-heroine feline theif Catwoman/Selina Kyle. I loved her first moment where we saw her true voice and I loved her scenes with Batman. We also see the famous love romance between the two.Sit Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, and Morgan freeman also pull off great performances, as well as newcomer Joseph Gordon levitz who plays important character Officer John Blake. (Spoiler: it turns out that his real first name is ""Robin"")Conclusion: you will never get tired of watching this as well as the first two Nolan Batman movies.

Nolan, in his attempt to create an epic conclusion to the trilogy, introduces a multitude of characters and plotlines that only serve to confuse and overwhelm. The convoluted story meanders through unnecessary subplots, leaving me struggling to find a cohesive and engaging central thread. The pacing is uneven, with moments of excitement drowned out by prolonged stretches of tedious exposition.Despite the return of Christian Bale as Batman, his performance fails to leave a lasting impression. The character's emotional depth, which was severely lacking in ""The Dark Knight,"" is still absent, and Bale's portrayal feels more like a tired rehash of the abysmal previous iterations rather than a fresh take on the iconic hero. Tom Hardy's Bane, while physically imposing, lacks any meaningful depth and nuance that makes a compelling villain. Bane's dialogue, often muffled by his mask, becomes a source of frustration, leaving me struggling to understand the supposed 'brilliance' of the character. The much-anticipated clash between Batman and Bane is a cinematic failure that is feels like a complete mess and is nothing short of anticlimactic, lacking the intensity and emotional weight that should accompany such a pivotal moment.While the film boasts somewhat acceptable visuals and set pieces, it struggles to maintain anything remotely close to a consistent tone. The attempt to ground the story in realism clashes with the more fantastical elements introduced, resulting in a disjointed and jarring viewing experience. The overreliance on CGI, especially during the climactic scenes, detracts from the grittiness that defined the earlier installments of the trilogy.""The Dark Knight Rises"" also fails to provide a satisfying resolution to the character arcs introduced in the previous films. The film's attempts at tying up loose ends feel forced and contrived, leaving me with a sense of disappointment and a lingering feeling that the trilogy's conclusion could have been handled more skillfully.In conclusion, while ""The Dark Knight Rises"" may marginally surpass the disappointment of its predecessor, it still falls hundreds of miles short of being a decent cinematic experience. The film's convoluted plot, lackluster performances, and tonal inconsistencies prevent it from reaching even a satisfactory standard for superhero films, ultimately leaving me with a conclusion that makes me feel like I've wasted 2 hours and 44 minutes of my precious time and lost valuable brain cells yet again.",2 December 2023

Whether you're a casual movie-goer or a dedicated cinephile, there's something enchanting about the world of cinema that captures our imaginations.Flashbacks, a narrative technique where a scene from the past is interjected into the present, can add depth and emotion to a story. It's like turning the pages of a book and discovering a hidden chapter that changes your perspective. In the realm of movies, flashbacks serve as windows into a character's history, providing insight into their motivations, fears, and desires.Imagine watching a film where the protagonist, haunted by a mysterious past, slowly unravels the threads of their memories through poignant flashbacks. The audience becomes not just spectators but active participants, piecing together the puzzle of the character's life. These glimpses into the past can evoke empathy, making the storytelling experience more profound and engaging.On the other hand, not every movie relies on the magic of flashbacks. Some films captivate us with unknown scenes, keeping us on the edge of our seats as the plot unfolds. The thrill of the unknown can be just as gripping as a well-executed flashback. A mystery that gradually reveals itself, scene by scene, adds an element of suspense that keeps us guessing until the very end.Now, let's talk about the sheer joy of watching a movie, regardless of its narrative techniques. Even if a film doesn't delve into flashbacks or unknown scenes, the magic lies in the experience itself. It's about losing yourself in the world created by the filmmakers, immersing yourself in the characters' struggles, triumphs, and everything in between.Personal preferences often shape our cinematic journeys, and for many, Batman holds a special place in their hearts. The caped crusader, with his brooding charisma and dedication to justice, has become an iconic figure in the world of cinema. Whether you're a fan of Christopher Nolan's gritty realism in ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy or Tim Burton's gothic stylings in ""Batman"" (1989), each iteration brings something unique to the table.There's a universal allure to Batman that transcends generations. His internal conflicts, complex relationships, and unwavering commitment to his mission make him a timeless character. From the pages of comic books to the silver screen, Batman has evolved, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of superhero films.Speaking of superheroes, the mention of DC movies brings to mind a vast and diverse cinematic universe. From the awe-inspiring power of Superman to the enigmatic charm of Wonder Woman, DC has given us a tapestry of characters and stories to enjoy. Whether you're drawn to the cosmic adventures of the Justice League or the gritty street-level heroics of characters like Batman and the Flash, DC movies offer a spectrum of experiences for fans.In the end, whether it's the allure of flashbacks, the excitement of unknown scenes, the timeless appeal of Batman, or the expansive world of DC movies, the magic of cinema lies in its ability to transport us. Each movie is a ticket to a new adventure, a chance to escape reality and explore the boundless realms of imagination.

rw9531444,ur110212703,tt0172495," Dreary spectacle
",6,"Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting ""Democracy"" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing.",31 December 2023

Historically, it's a bit comical in its inaccuracies, but most films of this ilk usually are. Someone on here mentions that it's like the best epics of the 1960s. Problem is most of those were not very good and have aged as badly as this has. Bloated, unrealistic and too long. Actually it's two and a half hour length seems much longer than that. Russell Crowe won an Oscar for this and it's a great powerful, physical performance and he's always good here, but if they wanted to give him an Oscar for best acting they should have waited one year for A Beautiful Mind. The rest of the cast is fine especially Joaquin Phoenix and Djimon Hounsou. No doubt there are some sequences that are truly exciting and well staged, but in between is just some really boring dialog stretched thin with a somewhat ridiculous finale. I'm not sure if this is a case of my tastes just changing or this aging badly, but my best guess is it's some combination of both. Like that other reviewer stated, it is sadly like a 1960s epic.

",9,"Gladiator is of the best movies I've seen in five decades, that is multifaceted and multidimensional, to include an amazing story, excellent actors (and not just the main characters), raw emotions, Soul-igniting and deeply heartfelt moments, captivating and convincing cinematography, authentic and interesting dialogues, a perfect amount of humor, drama, action, suspense, and romance, plus many Consciousness expanding themes, and their perfectly supporting, polar opposite aspects (like respect, loyalty, honor, trust, faith, courage, etc.).You know a movie is TIMELESS when you and those you know have watched it more than once, and continued to thoroughly enJOY it, as well recommend it to others.Russell Crowe did an extraordinary job of representing a BALANCED (merged physical & spiritual worlds), BAD@$$ MAN of ""STRENGTH & HONOR.""And because of his BIG Heart & discerning mind, deep character, very handsome outer appearance, and many other wonderful aspects of his Full-Potential Self/self, he continues to be the HOTTEST, male, Hollywood character of all movies (from my perspective).And Joaquin Phoenix is a VERY TALENTED actor as well, whom I felt compassion for despite his ""sad and bad"" role. I trust that he would've turned out different had his father unconditionally loved him, especially respecting and appreciating his own, unique strengths and qualities that are just as valid and invaluable.But it's understandable back in those days that humanity wasn't aware, lost in the DARK/SHADOW/UNKNOWN (without a discerning open mind/wisdom/Light Frequency/God essence).And because of closed or narrow minds, humans also didn't really know the meaning of needing to heal one's heart; hence, tuning into Unconditional/True Love (for the self/Self/others/interconnected Life within this world and beyond), though some people (especially mothers) had intuitively, naturally, and sporadically tuned into this energy state.Humanity has also been lost due our disconnect from the Mother Goddess, The Cosmic Heart & Womb/The Love Frequency/Compassion & Mercy/The One of Many Names, but ultimately The Nameless (like Her other half of the Cosmic Coin, God essence).S/He has been heavily oppressed, suppressed, and long forgotten by a patriarchal society, though balanced and harmonious Maximus (a Divine Human) prayed to both the Mother & Father aspects of the Divine, which I didn't catch the first time I watched this movie.Though I don't know much about Hollywood actors, and not interested in following their lives (just bits and pieces once in a blue moon), I also highly respect and admire who Joaquin is in real life, with some of his open-minded, BIG Hearted, deeply heartfelt expressions, to include suggesting to humanity that we have more compassion for various forms of Life. He, too, is handsome inside and out in his own beautiful way.Recently, a family friend in his 80's shared that he loves historical movies. But we found out that he had never seen Gladiator and Braveheart, two of the top ones without a shadow of a doubt. Once we watched it together, he absolutely loved both.Granted, I shared with him that my least favorite parts of many historical movies are the old, repetitive, fear-based, outdated, and boring scenes about the ongoing, seemingly never-ending conflicts, battles, and wars; and he agreed that it's the same old stuff. But I get that such scenes come with the package deal of many historical movies.Hopefully, more AMAZING and memorable movies in the future will include a high level of GENIUS CREATIVITY, and less of the need to ""revisit the graveyard of old movie ideas (like the battle and war scenes),"" as one movie reviewer once expressed in such a SPOT ON way.And this includes more movies about Extraterrestrials who are highly evolved on energetic levels-mentally, emotionally, physically (via more DNA activation), and/or spiritually (and even technologically)-that actually exist within our Galaxy, Universe, Multiverse, Omniverse and beyond.That's why two other favorite movies of all time are Avatar 1 & 2 (though the first one was better).The idea that ETs and aliens are only or mostly bad and evil is beyond OLD, fear-based, ignorant, and BORING.",26 December 2023

",10,"Even though Tim Burton did not direct this film, it is impossible not to think that The Nightmare Before Christmas is his best work. This is a film with a very original idea that has all the elements that characterize Tim Burton's vision. It is a fantastic story with terrifying and charming elements at the same time. The clash between two festive dates that are very different because of how terrifying one is and how joyful the other is. The characters are quite a peculiarity and the one who steals the entire film is definitely Jack. The inhabitants of Halloween Town have all the elements of a Halloween party and Jack is a clear variant of the legendary Jack O' Lantern. Here Jack feels tired of doing the same thing every year and decides to make a change in his routine, trying to spread Christmas cheer to find a new purpose, but without taking into account the imbalance that he can cause. Another character that is also worthy of praise is Sally who is definitely the voice of reason and the love she feels for Jack makes her care about him. The characters are as quirky and unusual in personality and design as they always should be in a Tim Burton story. The stop-motion animation helps a lot with the strangeness that the characters have and that is why it is still something very admirable to see in this film. The production design and art are faithful to Tim Burton's vision in many ways. This is due to his strong participation in the production. The soundtrack composed by Danny Elfman is also another admirable element of the film. The songs are unforgettable and have become somewhat iconic for the Halloween and Christmas seasons. It is ironic that Henry Selick has been overshadowed, since he has been in charge of directing and has done a good job, not forgetting to mention that this was his first feature film. His participation was also important and this experience was what led him to make Coraline years later. It is really curious that this has been a case in which a director has been able to create his greatest masterpiece without the need to direct and only taking care of the rest of the production. All the technical details have Tim Burton's vision and essence, as does the story he created. The Nightmare Before Christmas is definitely the best film in Tim Burton's filmography, one of the best animated films in history and a wonderful classic to enjoy at Halloween and Christmas. My final rating for this movie is a 10/10.",19 December 2023
rw9489428,ur15298231,tt0107688," Christmas Evel
",7,"Tim Burton wrote and co-produced this short, musical, stop-animation feature, (it was directed by Henry Slick, but has Burton's fingerprins all over it)) as an antidote to other cuddly seasonal features which are available, cleverly conflating probably his own favourite holiday season Halloween with everybody else's, Christmas.The story's quite simple and straightforward, Halloween Jack (wasn't that a line in a Bowie song?) Skellington (love that spelling!) organises Halloween for his fellow town residents but has lately become bored in the process. To rejuvenate himself, he decides to borrow a few tricks from neighbouring Christmas Town where he thinks a little mix-and-match of the two holidays might succeed. It does seem a bit like painting a moustache on the Mona Lisa and his adoring girlfriend Sally Finkelstein, who is forever trying to escape the attentions of her creator, Dr Finkelstein, tries to tell him so, but headstrong Jack carries on regardless, his master stroke, or so he thinks, being to kidnap Sandy Claws (his spelling), take his place and dispense much less wholesome toys to all the nice boys and girls. Actually in this day and age, I'm not sure old Jack wasn't onto something considering some of the videogames kids play today.Anyway, at least in 1993, he gets it wrong, spoiling every youngster's Christmas morning and at the same time jeopardising Santa himself who he's left in the care of the bad old Boogie Man. Who knows though, maybe Sally can literally pull herself together and help Jack to save the day...For me, the most disappointing feature of the movie was the rather lukewarm soundtrack provided by Danny Elfman. None of the songs stay in the memory although I will concede they do help the story along. I liked two sequences in particular, Jack's disastrous delivery of the kiddies' gifts and the showdown with the Boogie Man. The animation is excellent throughout, recalling for me anyway ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Yellow Submarine"" and even ""H. R. Pufnstuf"". Perhaps I'd have liked a few more good jokes in the dialogue and a little bit darker treatment in the narrative, but on the whole, I'll take Burton's, let's call it a grey Christmas, over ""The Snowman"" any old Christmas Day.",11 December 2023

",10,"An animated Disney production from 1993 directed by Henry Selick (Coraline, Wendell & Wild), The Nightmare Before Christmas follows ""Pumpkin King"" Jack Skellington's doomed adventures from Halloween Town to Christmas Town and back again.Based on a story and characters by Tim Burton, the film is a stop-motion animated musical featuring the singing voice of Danny Elfman, who also wrote the score. While it wasn't a huge hit initially, it soon achieved cult classic status and is seen, to this day, as one of the best animated features of all time. Two holidays are cleverly intertwined here as Jack Skellington (voiced by Chris Sarandon), a Halloween hero, grows tired of entertaining his usual ghoulish crowd, delivering the same spooky thrills year after year. When he discovers a place called Christmas Town, he becomes enamored with the entire concept and so decides to... take it for himself.A loving yet twisted pastiche of classic Rankin/Bass specials, as well as Dr Seuss' How The Grinch Stole Christmas and other classic cartoons, The Nightmare Before Christmas lures you in quick with its delightfully macabre ""This Is Halloween"" tune and it never lets go as Danny Elfman offers catchy song after catchy song, making the most of each one in his own unique style. This may have been Tim Burton's idea, and it may be Henry Selick's masterpiece, but it is, first and foremost, Elfman's baby: his work here is nothing short of genius and deserved a lot more recognition back in the day. From the lonely ""Jack's Lament"" to the bombastic ""What's This?"", the beautiful ""Sally's Song"", the playful ""Making Christmas"" and the devilish ""Oogie Boogie's Song"", the movie never missteps and is singalong-worthy from start to finish.The animation here is, frankly, incredible. This is stop-motion at its best with every shot carefully composed, Tim Burton's art style perfectly captured and the emotions of all these bizarre characters conveyed with great care. The character design is unique, the settings are appropriately gothic and countless inventive techniques are used here to make the animation flow in harmony with the music. The film looks gorgeous, of course, but it also has a timeless, nostalgic feel that'll make you want to watch it for both aforementioned holidays every single year. We care about these characters, feel for them, and can't wait to see them naively attempt the impossible in true Halloween Town style!Few animated films manage to get everything right: The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of those rarities. Hugely entertaining, a visual treat, a truly fantastic musical and, despite its frightening look, very very funny, not to mention filled with the magic that many Christmas movies promise but so often fail to materialize.

It is so high, that I can safely say, ""cricket is considered as religion, not simply a sport"".Economically, we can validate this craze by looking at the funds that the different cricketing boards have. India's cricket authority board, BCCI has astronomical amount of funds - maximum of all, and even larger than ICC (World's Cricket Authority).Politically, it's importance is also very great. The politicians never fail to congratulate Indian team for their performance on their winnings. Jay Shah, son of Amit Shah was made as the President of the BCCI seeing the vastness of the board.Socially, the craze of cricket is so high that, the religiously clashing groups - Hindus and Muslims come close and united during matches against Pakistan.Environmentally, the world of cricket creates tons of pollution in one single match, due to the scale at which it is organized. Ranging from power consumption, fire crackers, vehicular emissions, plastic/non-biodegradable wastes, etc., all these become reasons for the severe environmental impact.Coming back to movie, and MS, I'd say, this one movie was able to depict the struggle of a commonner kid, who lacks facilities and faces alot of problems in receiving his selection at the Indian Team. There is cut-throat competition, Yuvi makes it before MS, due to excellent performance given by him. MS doesn't loses his calm, he is very persistent and also works at Railways. His dedication help him take a big decision, of leaving the job and taking up cricket as his career, which later turned out pretty well for not just him, but for India as well.The role is well displayed by Sushant, who's all the time sincere looking as Mahi does, and his also very calm and gentle.A great movie to watch.",15 June 2023

",9,"Usually Indian film fans are divided according to the regions. Because if you turn any corner in that country, there's another film industry, another English alphabet replaced to rhyme with Hollywood. They have got their own bunch of actors, filmmakers and films. They might be divided over films and film productions, but they always united when it comes to cricket.Remember one and a half decade ago an Indian film about the same sport made into the Oscars, but did not win. This film was based on the life of one of the greatest Indian and world cricket player. So length into breadth of the India, it was a highly anticipated sport- biographical film. India has a long history of cricket. It was brought into the country by the British nearly half a millennium ago. It is called a gentlemen's game, which means only rich and royal people can play.So in India, cricket was always been a game highly influenced in big cities. Players from those places are high in demand till recently. Talents from second and third tier cities never been noticed. But some player made it because of political and other sort of influence. That's changed forever when Mehendra Singh Dhoni's success inspired millions of people. Made youngsters to take bat and ball believing someday they can play for their state or in the national team.If you are an Indian, I'm sure you had heard many things about him, his difficult path to stardom. There's nothing much difference in the life journeys of his and Shivaji Rao Gaekwad. They both were ticket sellers/collectors. Struggled through to initiate their profession, but in a different field. Now they're superstars.In Indian films, it's only recently the trend had started in biopics. For a cricketer, it is an ideal initiation. Remember Sachin Tendulkar's documentary film is due to release in this summer, but it is an international project. It can't be neglected because of his hardcore fans, not just in India, but across the world. He had retired a while ago, but still fans chant his name during the recent games.I know this director, since one of his films was remade as 'Someone Like You'. Bollywood films are always very stylish, but slips away while depicting realism of India, Indian society and culture. That's where I lost interest in them. I watched it for MS, since he plays/played for my team CSK who is known as Thala.Seems funny, some of the lines that translated into Tamil. But culture wise, it is understandable. A boy was born on the 7th of July '81, but soon the narration shifts focus on his childhood in the late 80s. A fine football goalkeeper, but changed his sport after an unexpected offer. Extremely interested in batting, but his opportunity was being a wicket keeper.When he enters his teenage, he had learnt to play his own method. Particularly in batting which is the least given privilege to him by his coach. Supportive parents, but from above that, the great friends gang, he had with him at all the good and bad times. The first half is all about the cricket. In fact the whole film was about him and the cricket, the rest of his life was not concentrated enough. I mean on other stuffs, except the romance that takes off during the beginning of the second half. So basically that's where you will come to know this guy is a man with feelings and emotions like you and me.We all knew him as a cricketer, a great cricketer to say. Since his romance parts come into play, for a brief moment the sport was set aside. A love story kick starts. All those who believed he's a superhuman, will come to realise after witnessing Bollywood style of romance, which is basically how happens in real India. He's not an emotion showing type, especially in public or during the game. But there's a scene in the film and when it appears, that's really heartbreaks. No offense, but it looked Sakshi demanded a proposal than expecting it to come her way naturally.I was bothered about the songs, but they smartly merged them with the storytelling. Particularly commercial films can't afford to lose the blue print of Indian cinema, since songs are the free television commercial, to popularise the film prior to its release. All the actors were great. The lead actor was at his best, especially when it comes to the technics in the games to match the Dhoni's style of play. Most of the locations are the actual locations, including the school, grounds and house(s). I think it was a good move.The film was not entirely true. They have changed the events to suit the cinematic. A man's 30 years of life journey to put into a 3 hour film, it has to be done and they did it neatly in Indian style. Some people are complaining about this and that, but that's understandable if you understand the concept of filmmaking, particularly money making film.Only the first two acts were very gripping. The final act was predictable, if you are an ardent cricket follower. Because you know everything on field about this man which is what covered in those parts. And the rest of the film was like behind the scenes of a film called his life. This is a wonder film, and I know the majority of the Indians won't miss it or had already watched it. But for the outsiders, this is not a bad flick, even if you don't know the sport or the player. Worth a try, otherwise definitely recommended.",21 May 2023

What is more frightening then the unknown? Well, James Cameron doesn't agree with me obviously. Aliens destroys the terror the first movie created by having multiple aliens in the film that you can fully see and can be killed easily by macho men and women carrying giant weapons. Compared to the first movie this is like a cartoon. No scares of any kind. Silly action and explosions. And the characters are stereotypes. Ridley Scotts characters were believable and grounded. Especially Ripley. Cameron turns Ripley into an unbelievable person like what Stallone did with Rambo. In the first movie you believe the character. In the sequels you dont.

",9,"It's been too long since I talked about the Alien franchise and what it means to the world of science fiction in general. The first movie took inspiration from some 50s classics and involved a group of terrified space travelers trying to fight off a creature that was tougher than all of them put together. Even if it weren't for the legacy of that film, tv shows, magazines, radio, and the internet all have a habit of reminding people how influential this series continues to be. This film, while taking place far into the future (even moreso than the first one) changes things up quite a bit, but also has many similarities with the first. The plot takes place 57 whole years after Alien. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has been frozen on a spaceship all this time in order to preserve her lifespan following a near fatal encounter with an alien creature known as a Xenomorph decades earlier. She is eventually found by employees of the Weyland-Yutani Corporation; the company that owned the mining spaceship Ripley blew up in the first film to destroy the xenomorph. Unfortunately, she was asleep for so long that employees at weyland don't believe her when she says the alien killed everyone on the ship except her. The small moon it came from, LV-426, is now being terraformed to make room for human life, but was uninhabited in Ripley's time. Due to the fact the board of directors think Ripley is making things up, her license to pilot spacefaring craft is revoked. However, weyland contacts her shortly after and apologizes. It appears she was potentially right about the xenomorphs being real, as human contact with LV-426 has gone offline. Still having PTSD from her xenomorph encounter, Ripley refuses any offers from weyland, but eventually agrees when told she'll be in the company of heavily armed space marines. On the marine ship Sulaco, Ripley meets the marines she'll be protected by but is hostile to a scientist named Bishop after learning he is an android, a synthetic human made to look just like a real person. Decades earlier, the Nostromo's android, Ash, nearly killed Ripley once his secret mission of wanting to protect the alien was uncovered. The marines and Ripley pile into a dropship and proceed at high speed to LV-426's surface. Little do they realize, a family of colonists had come across the same tuning fork shaped crashed ship from Alien, with its deadly cargo still intact. The marines investigate a power station and find no evidence of xenomorphs, but manage to locate a traumatized young girl named Rebecca, whose parents were murdered by the aliens. As the marines continue to look for the aliens in the power station, Ripley, stationed in an armored transport vehicle, realizes the station is fusion powered and any guns fired inside of it will basically cause a nuke to go off. The marines can't even use their guns to fight the xenomorphs (but flamethrowers are permitted). The marines discover a barely alive colonist with an infant xenomorph about to climb out of her midsection. They kill it (and her) and awaken a huge number of xenomorphs on the ceiling. In the ensuing chaos, most of the marines are killed, and Ripley goes against orders and plows the transport vehicle into the nest, allowing the survivors to get picked up. Among the survivors are Vasquez, Hudson and Corporal Hicks (Michael Biehn). The latter tells the dropship to come by and rescue them, but a xenomorph somehow ambushes the pilot and kills her, making it crash. Now alone, Ripley, the marines and Rebecca (called Newt by Ripley) fortify themselves inside the colony and set up a bunch of gatling guns outside. Bishop tells everyone that the dropship's crash damaged the fusion reactor's coolant supply and it's only a matter of time until it blows up with the force of a nuke. He crawls through a pipe to reach a transmitter to call down the Sulaco's spare dropship manually. Meanwhile, Ripley and Rebecca fall asleep in the lab, but are awoken by the intrusion of the horseshoe crab shaped aliens responsible for implanting eggs into humans (known as facehuggers). Ripley is nearly killed by one, but triggers the fire alarm and gets the marines to show up. It is then found that Burke, a weyland employee, tried to get Rebecca and Ripley implanted with eggs to smuggle xenomorphs past quaratine on Earth. The aliens then cut electricity to the colony and a big gun battle breaks out. The xenomorphs show up in huge numbers and kill Burke and Hudson. Vasquez is killed setting off a grenade to avoid being taken alive. Rebecca falls down a long shaft and is captured by a xenomorph. Bishop arrives in the second dropship and picks up Hicks, but Ripley says her task isn't finished just yet. She ventures alone into the alien hive at the processing station to save Rebecca. After saving her, the two accidentally enter the lair of the xenomorph queen, and the entire floor is engulfed in eggs. Ripley shoots at the queen with a pulse rifle and then sets fire to most of the eggs. After escaping, Bishop picks them both up right as the station explodes violently. After Ripley exits and congratulates him, Bishop is suddenly impaled and ripped in two by the xenomorph queen, who stowed away on the ship. Ripley acquires a powered mechanical suit from the Sulaco's cargo bay and fights the queen with it, managing to push it into outer space via an airlock (just like she did in the first movie). Rebecca is nearly sucked out too, but saved by Bishop's still functioning torso. Finally, Bishop (or what's left of him), Rebecca and Ripley prepare for the years long sleep on their journey back to earth. Aliens is a great sequel. It does what it's supposed to do: expand on the story of the original while adding in new elements to make it feel brand new. Of course, Michael Biehn had just been in Terminator with Schwarzenegger two years earlier, so selecting him to play the quintessential tough guy who always knows what to do seemed like a sound choice. Weaver is just as intrepid as she was in the first film, taking on swarms of xenomorphs and even venturing right into the heart of their colony to save the daughter she never had. The design of the aliens is once again really creepy, and HR Giger's style of art will surely give most people nightmares. Just like Alien, there is tons of suspense in this movie and the first time watching, it's really unpredictable. The movie always builds tension and makes you think a xenomorph is right around a corner, but when something does finally show up, it's not an alien. However, all the praise I've said so far is about to be flipped courtesy of just one scene. The part at the end where Ripley fights the alien queen is almost embarrassing, as the entire thing is just way too slow moving, not to mention the suit she's using to fight it is used for moving cargo. Out of context, the whole thing looks pretty ridiculous and it really soured the movie at the last minute for me. Still, that's the only part I think is strange and the rest of the film is full of the suspense and action Alien had in great abundance, so I'll let it pass. Yes, the strobe effect from all the gunfire is kind of headache inducing, but it didn't give me any problems.",1 December 2023

",8,"After the success of the first Alien film, it was inevitable that a sequel would come. But a large part of the fans of the first film and the lead actress of the film, Sigourney Weaver, thought that a sequel was a compulsion. But everything changed when James Cameron, who had signed a big hit like the Terminator at that time, took the director's chair. And from my point of view, I can say that Aliens is a film that surpasses the first film of the series in every respect. Not only is it the best movie in the series, but also one of the best science fiction movies of all time has been revealed.Aliens takes place 57 years after the first movie. Ripley, who has been wandering in the vacuum of space since the end of the first film, finds a new space crew and takes them Decoy. Now the technology, weapons are more advanced, but no one has taken care of the creatures. Ripley tries to prove this point to everyone, and he and a team go to investigate the creatures. As a result of some events, the team is trapped among the creatures, and this time the creatures are bigger and more dangerous Decoy.First of all, I should mention that I watched the director's fiction version of Aliens. This version is about 20 minutes longer than the normal duration of the movie, making the movie a much better one. If you are thinking of watching this film, I strongly recommend that you watch the director's fiction version.Now, I want to talk about why Aliens is one of the best science fiction movies of all time. Aliens has taken the atmosphere of tension from the first film and transferred it to a bigger place. In doing so, he made everything in the first film bigger and better.For example, the creatures are even more dangerous in this movie. Even the creatures we saw in the first movie create a greater tension in this movie. Thanks to this, an even more exciting atmosphere emerges.In fact, the only thing that makes the film good is just the atmosphere, visuals, etc. It's not things. The acting in this movie was also excellent. Can you believe that Sigourney Weaver was nominated for an Oscar for this film? I can safely say that he definitely deserves it. Weaver has not only portrayed one of the strongest female characters in cinema (let's not forget Sarah Connor), but also managed to bring an emotional depth to her character. Ripley's attempt to protect the boy Newt, seeing her as his own daughter, has further strengthened his character.By the way, I also liked the character of Newt in the movie. Dec. Carrie Henn, who plays Newt, managed to give a good performance despite her young age.Despite all its good points, I think Aliens has a few shortcomings. There are some predictable moments (for example, it is obvious at some moments what will happen to the side characters), sometimes there are sides such as weakening the story. But that doesn't make Aliens a bad movie, it just takes it a little bit away from being perfect. But in general, Aliens has been more successful than the first film of the series in any case. The characters, visual effects and script were really admirable. I definitely recommend watching it, you won't regret it.",30 November 2023

",8,"Aliens is not a perfect film, and it's not my favorite one James Cameron's directed, either. But I do find it a good deal more satisfying than the original Alien, even though I can appreciate it's more in-your-face, feels more like a ""movie,"" and therefore could alienate those who like the more restrained and grounded approach to Ridley Scott's 1979 film.It feels like there's more of a three-act structure here, the characters are broad and as a result, I would argue more memorable (though they do feel less like real people much of the time), and there are definite arcs that various main and supporting characters have. It also beefs up the action and explosions immensely, with plenty of combat scenes featuring numerous alien creatures and thousands of bullets being fired throughout.I feel like this was the right approach to take for a sequel to Alien, because many beloved horror movies peak with the first entry, and the sequels can feel like diminishing returns. Aliens still has some very tense and slightly scary moments, but it's a different kind of ride, and one with a good deal more action.

",9,"Inherit The Wind is a movie that I have had a love-hate relationship with, and just seeing it again for the first time in quite a few years, it's more on the love side.First off, I should say that I'm a Christian who believes in a ""literal"" interpretation of The Bible. I'll get into that later. I also love movies. Since Inherit The Wind is a movie about creation vs. Evolution, it has always intrigued me.While I loved it in high school, I learned about the actual Scopes Trial in which the movie is based, and I started to dislike the movie. However, I decided to see it again, and my mind was changed once again.Inherit The Wind is loosely based upon the 1925 court case known as The Scopes Trial. The case followed a teacher who agreed to lie about teaching Darwin in his classroom after a Tennesse state law made it illegal to do so.This led to a challenge to the law, which later made it illegal to ban evolution from schools on the basis that it goes against The Bible's teaching of creation in Genesis.Inherit The Wind takes this historical event and twists many things. In the movie, a teacher who rejects a small town's religious zest diliberately teaches his class that ""man descended from a lower order of animals.""He's arrested for this, and gets an agnostic lawyer named Henry Drummond to defend him- he's played by Spencer Tracy, and he defends the teacher's ""right to think"", and for his students to think about the clash between science and faith.Then comes Fredrich March as Matthew Harrison Brady, a politican who believes in Biblical literalism, and comes to fight the teacher's views on Evolution. Thus begins a court case battle of science and religion.These actors, Tracy and March, and other key stars like Gene Kelly, Dick York, and Harry Morgan to name a few, all give fantastic performances. The cinematography is beautiful in black and white, and the movie is all around very well made and engaging.There is also some great suspense, such as a scene in which Dummond challenges Brady on his knowledge of The Bible- which I will dig into later. As a Christian, this scene has many thought-provoking questions for my faith, while also being a bit harsh and biased.This is why I used to dislike the movie, and why I have subtracted a star from my rating: Inherit The Wind is a very one-sided movie in many ways.All the religious people in the town are hateful and bigoted, for example in one scene they harass the teacher while he's in jail (the real teacher didn't spend a minute there), and they sing to the tune of the National Battle Hymn of the Republic (a pro-North song sung by Southerners) that they will hang him to a sour apple tree for rejecting Genesis.A fictional preacher also appears in the movie named Jeremiah Brown. His daughter is the fiancee of the teacher, and the teacher is against Brown for preaching that an unbaptized child who drowned is in Hell.I can sympathize with the teacher here, as baptism is not a requirement for salvation- the repentant thief on the cross was most likely unbaptized, and Mark 16:16 says that ""those who believe and are baptized will be saved, but those who do not believe will be condemned."" So, this preacher isn't much of a theologian.When Brady is on stand, Drummond asks him many questions about The Bible- where did Cain's wife come from- Genesis 4:16? Drummond says that has never phased him and he'll leave that to the agnostics to figure out. (Many creationists point to Genesis 5:4, which says that Adam and Eve had daughters, and state that incest was not an issue at the time as Adam and Eve were the only humans on Earth.)Drummond also inquires about the impossibility of Joshua making the sun stand still in Joshua 10 or Jonah being swallowed by a whale, or as Brady corrects, a large fish. (Fun Fact: In the real trial, the real Drummond- named Clarence Darrow, misspoke here and asked Williams Jenning Bryan about Jonah swallowing a whale.)Brady says pretty much what I would here, that God is all-powerful and He can do with logic and physics as He pleases. Of course, back to my bias point, he is humiliated for making this statement, and creationism loses in court that day.Another problem that I have with this scene is that earlier in the movie Drummond wants some scientists to testify about what Evolution is, and Brady makes the objection that the case is about Evolution being taught against the law, not on if it is true, so the testimony should not be allowed. (In real life, Darrow renounces his own scientists on this basis.)Back to the movie though, it barely covers what Evolution is, apart from mentions of man evolving from apes, slime, and protisas. Basically, it shows why Young Earth Christians reject Darwin, but then brush it aside to point the finger at The Bible.In other words, the movie is like: ""Yeah- I believe we came from slime, but that's not as silly as Cain having a wife!"" If the movie's message is that one should think about their own beliefs, and it's going to mock Christianity, shouldn't the movie tell us more on what Evolution is?Returning to Brady's testimony- I also don't like that Brady says that sex is a sin. While there are sexual sins- lust, adultery, and so forth, sex between a husband and wife is a gift from God that an entire book of The Bible- Song of Songs- celebrates.I've given a list of flaws regarding how Christians are portrayed, but that's my only main issue. Many people think that this movie is true to the real case, and it's not. If you are going to watch it, keep in mind that Inherit The Wind is a movie, not a documentary.If you are watching this movie for facts, then avoid it and look to Alleged for a closer re-creation of The Scopes Trial. If you want great performances and filmmaking with a thought-provoking take on science and religion, then I highly recommend Inherit The Wind.Fun Fact: The movie's title comes from Proverbs 11:29: ""He who causes trouble on his house will only inherit the wind.""",3 January 2024

The oeuvre of Stanley Kramer contains films with subjects that were much more socially relevant to me such as ""Judgement at Nuremberg"" (1961, fascism) and ""Guess who's coming to dinner"" (1967, racism).That is what I thought, before discovering that trials about teaching evolution theory and / or creationism are not a thing of the past. In for example ""Kitzmiller vs Dover"" (2005) the question was if schools can be forced to teach also creationism (alongside of the evolution theory).With regard to the acting performances in this film the following. The two lawyers are played by Spencer Tracy and Frederic March. Together they are an acting powerhouse. As good as this may be for the quality of the film, its a pity that they somewhat outplay the characters of teacher Bertram (played by Dick York) and his fiancee, also daughter of the fanatic reveree, Rachel (played by Donna Anderson).At first Rachel tries to convince Bertram to back down. He tells her however that if he would do so, he would no longer be the same person and she would no longer have the same lover. After that Rachel chooses his side.The two lawyers are better at keeping work and private life separate. After the court sessions they have a drink together in the evening, reminiscing about their student days together.",8 August 2023

",9,"""An idea is more important that a monument and the advancement of Man's knowledge more miraculous than all the sticks turned to snakes and the parting of the waters."" Henry DrummondFredric March and Spencer Tracy - who is fast on track to becoming my favorite actor - go head to head in a verbose, dramatic, high stakes trial based on the 1925 Scopes Monkey trial, that shows just what monkeys humans are (and that is an insult to monkeys) and pits Darwin's theory of evolution against creationism in court.Grab yourself a huge leaf fan and some lemonade before sitting down to watch this stellar cast, (directed by the brilliant, unheedingly opinionated Stanley Kramer), steam in a Tennessee courtroom. Beads of sweat drip down their brows as they posture, position, and debate the fundamentalist interpretation of the bible versus the right and need to teach science in schools.Biology teacher Bertram T. Cates, (i.e. John T. Scopes), played by the inimitable Dick York is accused of teaching evolution in school and arrested. The biased judge played by Harry Morgan bars all the scientific experts from witnessing for the defense. Makes sense...Questions of separation of church and state vs. Acknowledgement of science are explored in this exceptional film classic with a narrative that continues to present day in so many ways.In my ideal world, I'd have liked any hint of political correctness thrown out with a heathen - atheist replacing the moderate - agnostic role Spencer Tracy played as lead defense attorney.March, as preacher Matthew Harrison Brady, (based on his real life counterpart, William Jennings Bryan), and Tracy as Henry Drummond, (based on his RLC, Clarence Darrow), the agnostic defense lawyer, hold nothing back. Their sparring reminds me of a heavyweight match that used words and wit, fire and brimstone. The scene where Drummond brings Brady to the stand as a witness had me on my feet, every bit of me engaged in this theatrical battle, waving fast my imaginary leaf fan to cool down.Gene Kelley, effective in his dramatic role as journalist H.

rw9139816,ur153983000,tt0053946," Works better as a political film than as a courtroom drama
",7,"I think Inherit The Wind is an unusual film, for it is prescient and outdated at the same time. The film is prescient in anticipating the age old conflict between religion and atheism, and the issue of religion in education. But it is also outdated in characterising its adherents as subscribing to an interpretation of the bible which is vociferous, strident and literal- something which only teh most zealous of Christians subscribe to nowadays.The thematic message of Inherit The Wind is laid bare skilfully by director Stanley Kramer. Spencer Tracy plays the attorney who is a staunch atheist, while Frederic March plays the zealous defender of religion. Tracy and Gene Kelly's character are portrayed as the good guys in this film- They cleverly tear apart the bible as merely a text full of contradictions and inconsistencies. Tracy's character in particular argues that man is gifted with the unique power of reasoning, and he must utilise it to question assumptions and fulfil his curiosities. But ultimately Tracy's character comes down on the perspective taken by most Christians today- that a literal interpretation of the bible is unhelpful. That overzealousness must be tempered. That belief can exist outside of cold scientific logic. And that faith ultimately exists so people can believe in a cause, and feel passion for something. I find this to be a balanced view which feels right, but overly right today. This view has little or no contention in todays society, and as a result the overzealousness of the mob in the film felt outdated- that few people would be so passionate about religion today.Beyond the films thematic elements, I also have to commend the remarkable performances. Frederic March delivers an astounding performance as the impassioned defender of religion. He has allowed religion to absorb into His life so much that it has ironically caused him to lost perspective on what is right and wrong, he turns into an unhinged man rambling and babbling incoherently by the end of the film. Tracy also enjoys a nice character arc as a staunch atheist who becomes more open minded by the end, probably a reminder from the townsfolk on the dangers of stridency. The exceptional screenplay also deserved commendation. The dialogue effectively uses wordplay, puns, metaphors, and witticisms to dazzle the audience which the sharpness of these legal minds. In a memorable scene, Tracy's characters intelligently substantiates his beliefs using a metaphor. He argues that while being different may mean being alone, falling in line with what others think means a forfeiture, a relinquishment of one's power of reasoning, spelling a grim path backwards. Lastly, The cinematography also deserves praise. The cinematographer has elected to use his camera creatively which successfully enhances the drama and stakes involved. He utilises Dutch angels in the preaching scene to show the impassioned masses, and close ups in the court scenes to show the pain on the lawyers' faces as they try so desperately to convince each other of other own beliefs.However, I find the film to be lacking because its premise is problematic. I find that after the first hour, the film becomes tedious because its courtroom setting begins to crack. The issue is that Tracy fights an unjust law. The loud, vehement arguments which unfold in the second act may provide opportunity for bravura dramatic acting for Tracy and March, but it ultimately loses realism in the courtroom setting. This is because while moments may heat up in a legal battle, much of the process in a courtroom drama is ultimately about building sizzling suspense with the reveal of facts. In this film however, the facts of the case are clear, and it felt desperately that Tracy's case should be taken up with a legislative body rather than a courtroom which is supposed to uphold rather than make the laws. This film hence felt more in place as a political drama rather than the courtroom film. Perhaps this is why the film never had the riveting tension and suspense which I so admired in courtroom movies.At the end of the day, Inherit The Wind is a remarkable picture. It is spearheaded by powerful performances, innovative cinematography, and an exquisite screenplay. But the driving message of the film felt slightly outdated and irrelevant and most importantly, I find that the courtroom setting loses the film some realism and entertainment. Overall, Inherit The Wind is a thoughtful, powerful, though flawed film.",22 June 2023

",7,"A young biology teacher, in some southern backwater, teaches the students the theory of evolution, in violation of a local law that prohibits teachings that conflict with the Bible. Two famous lawyers take on the roles of prosecutor and defense attorney and we watch the court process, the battle between Darwinism and Creationism, that is, free thought and dogmatism.Kramer is known for films with a strong socio-political message (The Defiant Ones, On the Beach, Judgment at Nuremberg, Pressure Point, Ship of Fools, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner) and this one does not deviate from that template. It is based on a true event from 1925, but the story has been altered and exaggerated to make a point. That might be fine if it were a satirical comedy, but this courtroom drama is so overblown and caricatured that there is no trace of drama or tension. Combined with overacting and especially some of the music, the result is quite frivolous and at times very irritating.With all due respect to the acting legends (Spencer Tracy, Fredric March, Gene Kelly) and Stanley Kramer's legacy, I think this 1960 black-and-white classic fell far short of its potential.7/10.",25 May 2023
rw9071852,ur0001220,tt0053946," Shallow and phony to it's core
",7,"This film adapts the play based very loosely on the so-called ""Scopes monkey trial"" of 1925. Tennessee passed a law forbidding the teaching of any theory that contradicted the Biblical account of creation in publicly funded schools. The ACLU decided to mount a challenge and high school teacher John T. Scopes volunteered to turn himself in for having taught Darwin (he probably hadn't since he wasn't a biology teacher, but he agreed to be the test case).It's worth noting that this was really a show trial. Scopes recruited students to testify against him to guarantee he'd be charged. The judge essentially instructed the grand jury to indict him. Both sides sought celebrity counsel (H. G. Wells was asked to join the defense, but he declined since he had no legal training, even in Britain). The prosecution recruited William Jennings Bryan, a three time Presidential candidate and former Secretary of State, and defense enlisted famed agnostic attorney Clarence Darrow. The defense was partly funded by the Baltimore Sun, who sent H. L. Mencken to cover it.Nothing that really happens in this film (or the play it's adapted from) resembles the real events very closely. The Scopes stand-in Dick York is really arrested for teaching evolution. Spencer Tracy is Darrow and Frederic March Bryan ... although all have fictionalized names. Gene Kelly is the Mencken stand-in. This is really good mainstream filmmaking of the period with a host of good performances. It's also, like a lot of Stanley Kramer's work, very intellectually dishonest.My complaint is not that this is not how the real case played out, but that it portrays the debate as all about the freedom to have ideas, which is obviously not the point and is really a cowardly compromise. Consider a law that forbid the teaching of Holocaust denial in school. I'd suggest that neither Kramer nor most people would oppose that, yet if the issue were really the freedom to think, I think you'd have to grant that that includes the freedom to think very stupid and wrong things that we don't want people teaching children.The real issue is that schools should teach what is thought to be the nearest approximation of the truth by the people who are experts on the subject at hand. If scientists think evolution is true, that's what children should be taught. Any parent who feels otherwise can tell their children they disagree, but the content of classes should not be held hostage by the whims of the general public. This is the real issue at hand, and it's why Darrow eventually changed the plea to guilty in the real trial and appealed to higher courts that could challenge the substance of the law.This is a nice, well-made (and vey well-acted) film that is very representative with my issues with Kramer as a filmmaker. He mikes nice films that appeal to middle-class liberals while not really saying anything really controversial or getting to the real meat of the issue. He stacks the deck here by making the opponent Claude Akins playing the worst kind of hateful, narrow-minded fundamentalist.",22 May 2023

The six-year-old was performing in a variety show in Los Angeles and Chaplin was so impressed that he persuaded Coogan to come and work for him instead. The two new companions then set about shooting ""The Kid"". With that, an instant classic was born.Although ""The Kid"" was Charlie Chaplin's first full-length feature film, he made it the way he always used to make movies. The comic genius wrote, produced, directed and starred himself. In addition, Chaplin edited and cut the finished result. And, not to forget, he also composed its rousing score. As the absolute perfectionist he was, Chaplin wanted total control over every aspect of his cinematic work.In the movie, a tramp (played by Charlie Chaplin) finds an abandoned baby boy in a rough alleyway. After initially failing to give the child away to some strangers, the tramp decides to take care of the kid himself and make sure he gets a proper home.Unfortunately, it wasn't long before dark clouds began to gather on the horizon. At this time, Chaplin was involved in a bitter divorce battle with his first wife. Therefore, he worried that her lawyers would try to attach his film to their settlement. In an attempt to save his masterpiece, the director packed most of the material he had shot for ""The Kid"" in twelve big crates. Chaplin then took the footage to Salt Lake City, where he spent a month in a cheap hotel room to edit the raw film.But sadly, Chaplin's worries didn't end there. First National was unhappy that their star had started making features instead of the very profitable short films he used to do for them.

It's just a little too disturbing sometimes. The police cars that drift in all different directions for no reason (a little too much glass was shuttered in the mall, imo), the ridiculous multi-police car crashes, and Carrie Fisher's (as Mystery Woman) failed attempt to kill Jake and Elwood by perfectly shooting around their bodies with a rifle are a few examples. The scenes that should have been exciting were instead boring. The same happened when I recently rewatched the old Superman movies starring Christopher Reeve. The heartwarming classic that I remembered as an exciting movie turned out to disappoint as much as The Blues Brothers. I must have enjoyed the type of action that the 80s produced as a kid on a greater level, which sadly isn't the case as a young adult. Furthermore, this type of action isn't something you would see today, and the film industry has improved a lot. My rating is based on today's standards; this movie clearly doesn't work as well in 2023 as it did in the 1980s.Finally, I think the plot is a little too slow and boring in the middle section, after Jake and Elwood get the band together, but this isn't a major problem like the previous ones mentioned.Even though I'm not super entertained while watching The Blues Brothers and could even find some sections boring, I will always appreciate, love, and watch this film forever!7/10.William Gurebo,

",9,"John Landis was inspired when he decided to direct a film like this one. In addition to bringing us the excellent music that integrates the soundtrack, it brings us high doses of very good humor and a captivating, intelligent and well-written story, based on the desire of two brothers to reunite their former R&B band, dissolved after them getting into trouble with the police, and using music to raise the money needed to maintain the Catholic orphanage where they grew up. It's a plot that seems subscribed, but considering that it's a comic and quite unpretentious film, it seems within a very acceptable level.The cast is simply outstanding and is full of famous names. Each one of them does the best they can, and the result of it all, combined, is truly positive. John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd manage the two main characters with panache and enormous talent, in a way that it's really hard not to dedicate all your attention to them when they appear on the scene. I really liked the absolutely serious way they say the jokes. We can't guess what will come out of their mouths. Carrie Fisher also appears here, in a smaller but quality work. And we need to highlight the enormous contributions of a wide range of immortal names in music, such as Ray Charles, Cab Calloway, Aretha Franklin and James Brown. Until near the end of the film, I really thought that the actors were very similar to them, but no.On a technical level, it's a film that looks more understated than it actually is. There's a lot of money invested there, and we can see that in the special effects and the staggering amount of cars and things that are destroyed throughout the film, as the Blues Brothers leave their trail of chaos in their wake. I got to the point of thinking that the Portuguese police would be happy if they had half the cars destroyed in the film! I also got the impression that shooting outdoors, especially in an urban environment, needed to interrupt normal traffic on the streets, which is expensive. Well, I've already mentioned the soundtrack, but it's worth stressing this point again: the film has excellent music and songs, and Jazz, Blues, R&B and Soul lovers will probably love this.",1 June 2023

",8,"This account of the life and times of King George VI of the United Kingdom, centered around his stammer, is directed with shameless sentimentality by Tom Hooper (The Damned United). But so long as it is done with this kind of candidness and art of narration, you can get away with far more mush than this. More than anything, The King's Speech is a brilliant character study, with Colin Firth's masterful work as King George VI at the centre of events. He conveys the king's combination of vulnerability and courage in an immensely sympathetic performance. Add to that the technical achievement with the speech part of the role, and you have a worthy Oscar winner.Alongside Firth, Geoffrey Rush gives a fine performance as King George's speech therapist and friend, and it is in this budding friendship much of the film's warmth and humour is based. It is a lenient and uncritical buddy portrayal, but through backdropping this against the most important historical events during the film's time-span, notably the death of King George V, Edward's abdication and the outbreak of WWII, Hooper finds a suitable balance between the amiable and the momentous. And this is the real genius of The King's Speech; the way George's personal struggle is being put into context and given consequence. As a result, the film is able to retain a high level of suspense as George and Lionel Logue team up in the king's private radio studio to broadcast his first motivational wartime speech, concluding an inspirational story, filled with humanity and insight, about an in some ways ordinary and in other ways extraordinary man.*Review written in 2011.",2 January 2024

",8,"Colin Firth carries off his part well, there's something very regal about him, bad tempered yes, privileged yes, but also sympathetic and undoubtedly a good man, we as the audience are always behind him. Public humiliation is something we can all relate to and it's difficult to watch some of the most awkward moments in the film. His strict upbringing is revealed to border on cruelty and child abuse, the kind of late Victorian 'discipline' dished out on many children which was considered acceptable in the past.The story takes place over a number of years on and off as he revives speech therapy, something I know absolutely nothing about so I can't comment on the accuracy of this part. The royal family is portrayed as being rather odd and dysfunctional and as an audience we can see a great deal of strain and unhappiness at points on the various characters. The relationship between Bertie and his wife. And daughters is portrayed as very sweet and affectionate however. The King George V is shown as a stern father who regards one son as a playboy and scoundrel and the other as a timid wet blanket and failure. Public speaking was of great importance to the royals and there was no hiding away from it. The radio or wireless was exciting new technology in the 1930s and the royal family seized it as an opportunity to address the whole nation at once, something before unthinkable.The focus of the story is very much on the bond and friendship between Bertie and his therapist who later becomes his confident, despite the rigid class boundaries of the day. There is no bad guy or antagonist in the story which was refreshing, though the threat of war and invasion by Nazi Germany is present in the background throughout the second half of the film.In terms of the cinematography the film strikes a nice balance between being both arty yet realistic, the camera movements are smooth, everything is well framed and the lighting of the scenes isn't overdone. With a smallish budget of just $15million the set designs and vintage cars all look very good to my eyes.Of course the story of an underdog overcoming their disadvantages and ultimately triumphing is a real crowd-pleaser and cinema is not short of films of this kind. Slumdog Millionaire, Rocky, Sea Biscuit, The Hobbit and Harry Potter are just a few that spring to mind. If I had a complaint about the film it would probably be that it was marketed as being slightly more funny and upbeat than it actually turned out in the final cut. Also Helena Bonham plays her part a bit too carefree and sassy for me. All the swearing too was also a bit unrealistic and unnecessary. These are minor faults though.",27 December 2023

It follows the interaction between Prince Albert/King George VI and his speech therapist, Lionel Logue.Prince Albert (Colin Firth) gives a disastrous speech in 1925 at Wembley Stadium due to the stammer he has had since childhood. It appears his father, King George V's (Michael Gambon) strict, almost abusive, raising of Albert only made it worse.

The storyline is narrow but fully exploited by the creative script. Unfortunately, it appears much of the drama is created and not historical.

The King doesn't stutter when he gets angry and when he swears so this short example of fouls language is probable needed to show that, but they could have gotten around that and made the film PG-13.The film is about the King of England's second son who never thought he would become King because his older brother is next in line. The prince has been stuttering since about age 5. He is teased by family members, especially his older brother and he is humiliated continually by his father, the King. The king makes his son give a radio address at the beginning of the film and he fails horrible because of his stuttering. Colin Firth, as the prince, (later he becomes king), does a wonderful job of showing this.The prince apparently has sought out help in the past. The film shows one example that is a total fail. His wife hears about a guy and goes to his office trying to schedule the guy on her terms and at her residence, but the guy is firm that it will be at his office and at his schedule. She concedes and schedules the prince as MR JOHNSON.At the first visit, the therapist finds out he will be working with the prince. He tries to show the proper amount of decorum but wants to be on a first-name basis, which is just none done with the royal family. However, he won't give in on this point. The relationship is antagonistic at first, which seems to help. Over time they became friends.The King dies and the older son becomes king but before his coronation be gives up the throne to his younger brother because he wants to marry a twice divorced, married American woman who is getting divorced a third time to marry him. Because the king is the head of the Church of England, the church will not allow him to marry a divorced woman and still be king. He doesn't want to be king unless he can have the woman he loves by his side. So, he gives up the throne to his brother (Colin Firth).The therapist and the prince work hard on the speech that he must give over the radio. He does a great job. So, they continue to work. Then before the King's speech he finds out that the therapist isn't a doctor or licensed therapist and gets angry. The therapist tells him that he never gave any indication that he was a doctor, he has no letters after his name. He tells the king that after the last war, WWI, he worked with a lot of returning veterans who had ""shell shock"" or injuries, and difficulty with speech. He also taught diction in schools and has performed on the stage in Australia. They continue working together but the cardinal isn't happy with the guy when he finds out that he isn't a trained specialist and tries to hire someone else, but the king basically tells the cardinal where to go.The king gives a speech when they are drawn into WWII, and he does a great job. Colin Firth does a wonderful job playing the part.This is a great historical film that is well worth watching.

rw8961276,ur3914439,tt1504320," The Last King of Stutland, a film that deserves to sit on the throne
",8,"""The King's Speech"" is a (very) British English-language live action full feature film from 2010, so this means that this one is also already soon 15 years old wow how time flies, but well, maybe if you come here a little later to check out this review of mine, it is already over 15 or even 20 years old. In any case, I got to watch this on the occasion of a film retrospective on British movies and it was one of the last films I saw before it ended. Or is about to end right now. As you can see from my rating though, this was one of my favorite watches overall from said retrospective. It was not the first time I saw this film and I am not eve sure if it was the second time or if I had seen it more than once before, but I dare say that this gets even better on rewatch. Of course, there is also a relatively current aspect to this film as the Queen of Britain died not too long ago and her parents, especially her father, are the protagonists from this movie. And she is also seen as a young girl or well I should say an actress is shown that portrays here and there are one or two moments to this character that in a way imply how her own road will be quite significant one day too. Actually, the main character here did not live super long afterwards and did not stay king for 30 years or so, a period (quantity-wise) that Elizabeth can only laugh about. But before we go into the details of the film, let's look at some of the basics and the production background. Of course, this movie that runs for almost two hours made huge waves back then awards-wise as it took home the big category Best Picture at the Oscars. Many people did not like or they especially did not like Tom Hooper winning the directing category over David Fincher, but oh well. I will not complain. I have never been a huge Fincher fan and I think Hooper did a marvelous job here and he directed one of my favorite films ever in ""Les Misérables"" not much later, so I am indeed happy for him and the accolades he received there. He also got to know the other end of the (cat) food chain not too long ago, but let's not go any further into detail there.Colin Firth won the Oscar for his lead performance in here and I think it is not undeserving, even if I will always prefer Geoffrey Rush if I need to pick between the two. Rush seems like a good choice here too with his own Australian background, but appearance in British films over the years and his character here has a similar background. Okay, he has not appeared in British films, but he comes form Down Under originally and also has an acting background and has lived in Britain for a long time apparently. Rush's performance was also a key reason why I wanted to see this film again. I am not sure I would have gone to the theater if he had not been in it. But glad I did anyway. Helena Bonham Carter also scored another Oscar nomination here and you will find other familiar faces I guess such as Jennifer Ehle playing Rush's character's wife and of course Timothy Spall with great recognition value as always and he plays Winston Churchill here. Would have been cool if he had gotten a Supporting Oscar nomination here as well, but it wasn't meant to be. Still, he is so overdue by now it isn't even funny anymore and of course we all know how Gary Oldman swept the Oscars a little later for portraying the same character. Churchill I mean. A great deal of the film's charm stems from the interactions between ""normal"" people and members of the British royals. There was of course the joking around with nicknames coming from HBC's character, but also the Bertie inclusion how he is called like that right away from the speech therapist.You will find many other interesting moments like the nickel reference (okay, that did not do too much for me, at least as a running gag), the moment when the main character can speak without problems when he hears music and does not hear his own voice etc. The latter was also a great moment when he listened to the tape again and so did his wife in this very memorable moment when it became clear they would return to see Rush's character. Or take the opening when we see the work of other speech therapists, in terms of stuff to take into your mouth or what they thought about smoking back then. This was one funny moment when Rush talks about those other therapists and their significant background and how said background that they were knighted basically confirms that they are idiots or whatever he said, even if Rush's character implies later on that he would love to get knighted as well. There was at least one other moment that made it very obvious that he was not scared of authority or reputation by any means. Making jokes was a vital ingredient of the main character's road to finding his speech. I must mention the ""I have a voice"" moment for sure as this is one that always gives me the goosebumps and I remember it very well. If there was any doubt to Firth not being tough enough for the role, then it got removed this very second. Many other really nice moments I can elaborate on here. Or actually it was really the same moment there when we see Rush's character sit on the throne to get a reaction out of Firth's character. Another memorable depiction of the absence of respect for authority and old customs. But still, the protagonist would not want any other therapist as he makes very clear the immediately afterwards to the important man offering him a specific candidate. Of course, there were also minor inclusions that were big successes, for example the brief moment when Rush's character has no young female secretary, but a boy with a speech impediment then himself takes care of the preparation and tells the main character to enter the room. Oh and the corgis! I may never forget about them in any royal-themed movie.This is of course also an interesting film from the history perspective, not only because of the inclusion of Hitler. There is a great deal of elaboration of a king becoming too old and his successor just not being the right man for the job, not only because of his romantic involvement with an American woman. These two we also hear listen towards the end then when the king's speech is on the radio. Who used the term ""king's speech"" for the first time? It may have been Churchill here, even if he is not yet Prime Minister at that point. More props to Spall. Anyway, said speech that is mentioned in the title is also the big spectacular highlight from the film at the very end. It takes quite a while and how it is delivered, also how we see the sheets with the signs on them, was truly magnificent and there was no way I could give the film any less than four stars out of five after this magnificent closure there. Beethoven is always appreciated, especially this particular tune. You can say it is pompous maybe, but it was really right for the occasion. Apart from that, you also hear some nice Mozart music, especially the one early when the (then not yet) king does not hear his voice, but also stuff that is rather for kids like inclusion of ""Camptown Races"". You will maybe not know the name of this piece, but you will know the melody 100% when you hear it. Even if all those are of course no original tunes, I am glad to see Desplat score an Oscar nomination for his score here. No pun intended! The film won four Oscars and the only one I have not mentioned yet is the one for screenplay I think and that one went to David Seidler. Really nice closure to his career. As for Hooper's win, it was of course spectacular that he took home the win for Best Director after this was his first theatrical release, even if he won big for the small screen before that too already. But back then, Best Picture and Best Director were surely more often for the same film compared to how it is now over a decade later. But actually, there as a little football-themed film before that that he released at movie theaters, but let's ignore that one for a brief moment.Back to this one we have here now: I could really go on and on about scenes and moments that I liked and stayed in the mind for me, but you get the message. A few things in terms of more dramatic conflict I found interesting were for example that Firth's character was not really a man too easy to get along with. On one occasions, he implies that he never really had friends and also it seems he never really opened up about the abuse (you can call it that) from a babysitter or what it was who let him starve etc. Until he talked about this to Rush's character, so he did make a connection with him. He was probably also impressed by the man's professionalism as we see during the ""my castle, my rules"" moment or when Rush's character talks to HBC's character early on and says something like that he is still optimistic he can cure her man if he wants to be cured and he doesn't care how many others have failed in the past. On the opposing side, there is then the moment when Rush's character during a walk goes one step too far then when he encourages the other guy that he should aspire to become King. This hurt their friendship (if you can call it that at that point already) for a little while, but eventually they manage to overcome it. This is really it then. Instead of going on and on even further about everything that I liked from this film like the ""hot air"" moment, let me rather encourage you see it (again) yourself. You will definitely not be disappointed. It is also as much of a feel-good film as it can be if we include the fact that we have elaboration on disability here and really tense pre-wartime political climate. I highly recommend seeing ""The King's Speech"". It is maybe not my number-one favorite from 2010, but without a doubt one of the best films from the year. All the awards attention is not undeserving. Oh and to say somebody is ""kinging"" as an activity is also hilarious, but shows indeed that he may not be the right person for the job.",30 March 2023

",7,"I honestly did not know about this movie until it was recommended to me, and by then I only knew about it being about grifters/con artists starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford; after watching this old 70s movie, I will say I can see why it was recommended to me, because it is a well-made movie that is meant to like it is from the 30s. The 70s movie The Sting (1973) is a well-made and well-acted movie that is nicely shot cinematography wise and can be occasionally funny; the movie mostly hangs on some suspense of the lead two characters succeeding at their con, and it is effective on how it is shown and how it is executed with them making smart decisions.Johnny Hooker and Henry Gondorff, played by Robert Redford and Paul Newman, work well together with Henry Gondorff being a professional when it comes to being a con, and Johnny Hooker is avoiding trouble after doing an average con to a crime boss leading to him conning the person again instead this time without him knowing; seeing both Johnny Hooker and Henry Gondorff working together to con this crime boss is entertaining how they put together their plan and execute it. I am on the main character's side the whole time, making them very entertaining to watch and you want them to achieve their goal of conning this person by lying and tricking him on multiple occasions.There is suspense in certain moments involving the person they are conning trying to figure them out, and when there are chase scenes, they are well shot and entertaining to watch seeing Johnny Hooker avoid this crime boss and his henchmen who are trying to kill him. The movie is nicely shot with nice long takes, and there are interesting transitions from scene to scene; the movie is split into different sections to build up to the ultimate con the characters are trying to succeed at. Also, though the movie came out in the 70s, the movie did feel like it was from the 30s, since that is the point in time the movie takes place in.The Sting (1973) is a well-made and well-acted movie that is nicely shot cinematography wise and can be occasionally funny; I know people who will think this movie is slow or boring, but the buildup to the con is entertaining with characters working well together and occasionally being funny when the movie wants them to be. I know lots of people like this movie, because of the actors and the year it came out, including it being about con artists; I liked it too and would also recommend it to those who have not seen the movie.",2 January 2024

",10,"There are many films about con artists and confidence games (Ocean's Eleven and its two or three sequels, for example), but I had never seen one that was so good-natured and in which the main characters were so likable. It's a light, family comedy from the 70s, in which a group of tricksters decides to risk their lives to deceive a powerful and rich mobster in order to avenge a friend, killed by his hitmen. This film was, at the time, a huge financial success in the USA and won notable awards, especially seven Academy Awards: Best Film, Best Director, Best Original Soundtrack, Best Original Screenplay, Best Costume Design, Best Editing and Best Art Direction!Therefore, it is difficult to believe that a film with such qualities has been forgotten, but it is true. I never saw it on television, I never heard much about it, I don't think it even had much visibility outside his country of origin. In Portugal there wasn't, but I understand why: the film premiered the day before the country experienced a military coup against the government, and the rest of that year was very complicated here, so no one was very willing to go to the movies. Therefore, I think that recapping this film and bringing it back to theater, in a possibly restored version, would be a gesture of complete justice to its quality.The film has three enormous actors who deserve praise for the work done here: Robert Redford shows value and talent in a film that will open many doors for him, Robert Shaw offers us one of the best dramatic exercises of his artistic maturity and Paul Newman shines and enchants us in the role of an elegant and friendly swindler full of tricks. Seeing these three great actors together on stage is simply delightful. The film also has a good secondary cast, with Robert Earl Jones, Charles Durning, Eileen Brennan, Ray Walston and other good artists.On a technical level, we have to surrender to the impeccable cinematography achieved by the meticulous eye of director George Roy Hill, in cooperation with a team of good professionals, and which perfectly emulates old films from the 30s with the advantage of color, in tones deliberately brownish, golden and yellowish. The sets, props and costumes are simply incredible: the cars can make classic admirers salivate and the costumes deserve a place in the closet of any gentleman with a taste for the ""old-style"" elegance they exude. The period is well recreated and the situations balance dramatic tension and humor well. The soundtrack is solidly based on Scott Joplin's piano melodies and is wonderful to listen to, and the titles are magnificently well-designed and have art in themselves.

The protagonist, The Ram, is no exception and has sacrificed everything in his life for wrestling, leaving his body and relationships in ruin.When The Ram suffers a heart attack, he begins to repair his human connections, though the tragedy remains at the core of the story. Despite the possibility of redemption, The Ram's self-destructive nature will inevitably lead to his downfall, a fact that we are aware of from the beginning.The up-close filming style and grainy look complement Rourke's exceptional performance, which brings a level of realism to the character that can only come from his own experiences. It's the small scenes where Rourke and Aronofsky's direction excel, delivering moments that feel authentic and often heart-wrenching.Watching Black Swan and The Wrestler together is a truly stunning experience.

rw9539113,ur66313365,tt23289160," Is 'Godzilla Minus One' worth your time and money?
",5,"This short review is to help readers living in Western countries decide whether Godzilla Minus One is worth watching.There's three things you need to know beforehand so you won't be disappointed:1) The movie is in Japanese but has English subtitles.2) CGI is pretty bad (although I actually prefer costumes and prostethics more than 100% computer graphics. I'd rather Godzilla looks like this than the CGI in 'The Marvels' for example).3) The movie is dialogue heavy. Godzilla scenes are few and far between. That's how they kept a low budget - by giving you 5 - 10 minute snippets of Godzilla and then it's back to lengthy scenes of dialogue in Japan.Wrong expectations are probably the biggest reason for how divided the audience reaction has been.Keep in mind that this movie had a 9-point-something score on IMDb before it was released in Western Countries. By East-Asian standards this is one of the best movies of all time. So there's a clear distinction between how the movie has been received in different regions of the world.Being from the UK, my biggest gripe with Godzilla Minus One is that with a $15 million budget you would expect it to have far more substance than style. I was expecting top tier, edge-of-your-seat drama to compensate for what the movie lacked visually. But that wasn't the case. The plot was incredibly basic and predictable. It thinks it's deeper than it is.So overall you're left with a movie that doesn't look great, doesn't showcase Godzilla doing much (just slowly walking around, stepping on people, knocking over buildings and hurling ships) and doesn't have much substance either.On the below scale...5. Absolute must watch in theaters.4. Worth the ticket price3. Shortlist and wait for streaming.2. Could miss it entirely.1. Complete waste of time. Avoid....it gets a 2.5 from me.",3 January 2024

I am not a fan of wrestling, but they made me feel for Randy and the extremes that he and other wrestlers will put their bodies through for money, fame or their fans.Wrestling may be fake and scripted, but the lives of the men and women involved is not.Aronofsky, when he is on, is the best at choosing actors that are perfect for roles - and here he nails it again with Mickey Rourke.The writing and story was empowering yet at the same time tragic, and the characters all had nice dynamics, contradictions and similarities. Cassidy and Randy both struggling with jobs, one that loves him and the other doing it to support her son - Cassidy and her son are close, Randy and his daughter are estranged. Yet both are lonely. Nice ebb and flow of emotions throughout.The sets and locations are rough around the edges, enhancing the realism of the characters. The camera work was voyeur-ish, again creating an atmosphere of this fallen icon. The image system and symbolism was good if you caught them.Definitely worth a watch for the decent characters and unique story.",15 September 2023
rw9247337,ur33162918,tt1125849," Adopting an almost documentary filming, Aronofsky shows a guy that prefers to put his (unfortunate) life at risk to hold on to the little happiness he has still had left
",8,"Written by Robert Siegel, the film begins with a collage of clippings that illustrate the colossal success achieved by Randy during the 80's, when he became an idol of wrestling fans and seemed to have a promising future - just like his interpreter, Rourke. Both, however, turned into unfulfilled promises not for lack of talent (which they have in abundance), but due to wrong decisions and, mainly, the destructive way in which they led their personal lives. Thus, when shortly after this initial montage we hear Randy's cough and find him again, twenty years later, alone in an improvised dressing room in a children's school, we are seeing not only the character, but also the sad reality of an actor who, from being a favorite of great filmmakers, turned into an outcast who spent years earning his living on cheap films.It is not by chance, moreover, that Aronofsky is slow to reveal Randy's face; in a way, he is also preparing us for the shocking reunion with Rourke, who, from a handsome young man, has transformed into a middle-aged man whose pockmarked face reveals the results of years of pain, disappointment and self-destruction. This, of course, is reflected in Randy, the character, who may even dedicate time to his hair and artificial tan, but whose impeccable physical form is, in large part, the result of the brutal use of steroids that consume his heart - and there is no exercise physique that can make up for decades of abuse in the ring, as evidenced by his heavy breathing, his constant moaning and his hearing aid. And it is in these similarities between reality and fiction, interpreter and character, that ""The Wrestler"" gains an additional dimension that makes it even stronger and more impactful.Employee in a supermarket and facing great financial difficulties, Randy does not give up, despite this, dedicating his weekends to his great love: wrestling - and the contrast between the degrading treatment he receives from his boss and the affection flowing from his fans partially explains why he is unwilling to leave the ring even after becoming a curiosity to be displayed in quasi-amateur matches. In ""real"" life, Randy may be a white trash, but like idol ""The Ram"", he is a hero who faces fighters who indulge in low blows and embody unsympathetic characters - all staged, obviously, as his teammates fighters are his true family, treating him with respect and even admiration.One of the most talented actors of his generation, Mickey Rourke displays, in ""The Wrestler"", all the care and precision in character building. Exemplifying all the physical limitations of the protagonist, Mickey Rourke suggests Randy's tiredness and indisposition from his constantly heavy breathing, also standing out by keeping his voice choked, as if he was making an effort to complete a single sentence. In addition, Rourke's physical performance convinces the viewer that Randy is always hurt and ""stuck"" thanks to the injuries he collected after decades of fights. Transmitting a truckload of emotions through small facial expressions, Rourke illustrates with wonderful sensitivity Randy's attempt to readjust to reality after receiving the news that he will no longer be able to climb into the ring - and his terrified look when he recognizes the decay of his ex- companions during an improvised convention in which he sells photos and autographs immediately indicates, to the viewer, his willingness to do whatever is possible and impossible to avoid a future similar to that of those people. It is at this moment, in fact, that Rourke's performance reaches an almost sublime level: notice how, little by little, he loosens up in his new role as a clerk, happily discovering his own pleasure in interacting with customers and realizing that perhaps it is possible to take a reasonably satisfying life away from wrestling. And notice, likewise, how suddenly, after almost 90 minutes of filming, he finally reveals his character's ugly side by cruelly offending stripper Cassidy (Tomei), allowing us to discover the inner monster that probably drove him to destroy everything. What he had built in the past.Not that we couldn't already intuit the existence of this nasty side of her - after all, the deep hurt exhibited by her daughter Stephanie had certainly surfaced for a reason. Incidentally, it is touching to see how, when informed by her father about the heart attack that almost killed him, Evan Rachel Wood hesitates in her display of anger: even after years of disappointments and pain, she seems terrified by the possibility of seeing him dead - maybe because this would destroy once and for all the already remote chances of a future of love and affection at his father's side. And when she is finally willing to allow a rapprochement, the girl gives her father a look of vulnerability that is absolutely touching, as if she were trying to say: ""Please, don't hurt me again.""Meanwhile, Marisa Tomei embodies Cassidy as a curious reflection of Randy's dilemmas: like The Wrestler, she hides behind a false name and leads a professional existence based on fantasies: if he pretends to be the mortal enemy of his teammates in the ring, she simulates lust and attraction for customers - and it is curious that it is Randy who lets himself be fooled by this ""fraud"". It is also interesting to see how Cassidy shares the curse of age with the protagonist: even though she is beautiful and has a sculptural body, she is already seen by many clients as an ""old woman"", realizing that, after all, perhaps the moment has arrived. To leave your own ring/stage. (And notice that, not by coincidence, the stripper has this epiphany exactly in the scene following the one in which Randy is shocked by the decadence of his former colleagues, deciding to change his life.)Fascinating not only as a character study, but also for its behind-the-scenes look at wrestling, ""The Wrestler"" reveals that, while widely regarded as a ""fake"" sport, this activity combines the planning of theater and the physical sacrifice of boxing: the blows can even be combined in advance, but that doesn't mean that The Wrestlers won't get hurt - and the ring covered in blood is proof of that. Also portraying the camaraderie of The Wrestlers, who are concerned about each other's safety while trying to offer an intense spectacle, the feature features small tricks of the profession, such as the razor blades that, hidden in the athletes' bandages, are used to open small gashes that have tremendous dramatic effect during fights - and I doubt that even actors of the caliber of Sir Laurence Olivier or Sir John Gielgud would be capable of punishing their bodies with staplers and razors for the sake of their Art.Siegel's script is absolutely happy to give the maximum realism to the journey of the characters, relying mainly on subtle and economical dialogues, however completely revealing and intimate, and that little by little allow the spectator to become more and more intimate with the figures on the screen. To do so, Darren Aronofsky leaves aside his usual stylistic resources, allowing other factors, especially the actors' performance, to make the film reach the desired goal. But Aronofsky also does his part, and by adopting an almost documentary filming, with his camera always following Randy from behind (which turns us into a kind of voyeurs of those tragic lives), the director emphasizes the visceral realism of Randy's journey towards the construction of a more solid and objective existence.Always following the protagonist with the camera more or less at the height of his neck, Aronofsky establishes two meanings with this approach: First, to portray the weight that Randy carries on his shoulders; and secondly, creating a visual rhyme with all the moments in which ""The Ram"" is walking to the ring. For life, after all, is a ring. And this rhetoric comes to a head in the masterful butchery scene, in which Randy, now working in the back of a supermarket, stands before one of those sliced butcher shop curtains, about to face his first day on the job, and hears ""Ram! Ram! Ram!"" in his mind-and what happens is that, when going through the curtains, Randy comes across another kind of ""ram"" (the remains of sheep that he will sell at the butcher shop). Still, he struggles to retain some remnant of his former life, treating supermarket customers exactly the same way he treated his fans (and even making a note on a package the way he signed autographs for his admirers). In other words: as much as Randy Robinson tries to be Robin Ramzinski (Randy ""The Ram"" is nothing more than a stage name), the fact is that, in practice, he is... Randy Robinson, or ""The Ram"". And the spectacularizing is part of his persona to the point of being reflected in the scene where he finally explodes, leaves the supermarket and decides to take up wrestling again (regardless of the risks that this may entail).If Rocky Balboa could always count on Adrian, Paulie and Mickey in the corner to support him, Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson ends the final fight alone. In Stephanie's case, for hating him; in Cassidy's case, because she cared enough about him that she couldn't bear to see him die in the ring. It is not known, of course, if Randy died at the end of ""The Wrestler"", since Aronofsky prefers to end the film without showing what came after the last ""leap of the sheep"". What matters is that ""The Ram"" ended its particular cycle feeling, at least, fulfilled. ""The Wrestler"" is a film that immerses the viewer in the excruciating routine of a guy who, unlike Rocky Balboa, has not had any ""comeback"", preferring to put his (unfortunate) life at risk to hold on to the little happiness he has still had left.",8 August 2023
rw9241587,ur110212703,tt0070735," Nostalgia for a Depression
",8,"There's always some semblance of nostalgia for decades past, and the 70s nostalgia for the 30s just fascinates me. I mean, the 70s had their problems, but the 30s had the Great Depression. Still, this and Billy Wilder's The Front Page stick out in my mind of well-produced, colorful embraces of 30s nostalgia with a fun bent to them. George Roy Hill and his writer David S. Ward apply that to the heist genre with a character-based adventure that, perhaps, ends up taking itself a bit too seriously for a while, but ultimately provides a fun time at the movies.Johnny Hooker (Robert Redford) is partners with Luther (Robert Earl Jones), doing small cons to make a living in Depression-era Chicago. One day they hit a numbers man working for Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw), a vicious, unforgiving gangster who takes the loss of $11,000 very hard, making sure to exact vengeance upon those who stole from him to ensure that he retains his strong position within the Chicago crime scene. This leads quickly to Luther's murder and Hooker going on the run, finding Luther's old friend Henry (Paul Newman), a broken down conman who could teach Hooker how to perform the long con.There. That's all you need from a character motivation point of view. You don't need anymore. Lonnegan is a bad guy. He killed a nice old man, and his young friend wants vengeance using a fun way to go about it, building a varied team to carry it out. And for most of the movie, it pretty well sticks to that. Hooker and Henry build up the team, most notably with J. J. (Ray Walston), Henry's girl Billie (Eileen Brennan), and Kid Twist (Harold Gould). They come up with the long con, The Wire, where they set up a betting house, read results through a radio that have already happened, and get the mark to drop a ton of money on a bad bet he thinks is guaranteed. To get Lonnegan to that point is a twisty turny journey involving a lot of lying, a rigged poker game on a train, and even taking over a back office at a Western Union.It's a big operation with a lot to keep track of, and there are a couple of other little twists to keep track of as well, mostly around Lieutenant Snyder (Charles Durning) who is after Hooker because he's a bit corrupt and Hooker paid him off with counterfeit money. There are also shadowy figures that may or may not be out to kill Hooker. It's a fun miasma of events and personalities anchored by some solid early character work and an even tone that doesn't let things go out of control.And then, for some reason, Hooker meets a waitress, Loretta (Dimitra Arliss), and gets all misty-eyed about finding a way out of the con life. I really don't understand why this is here, except as a potential twist around the identity of a killer, but the emotion that goes into it is just too heavy and working in a different direction for the film, especially since it's placed in the ramp up to the big sting. As a final twist before the playout of the sting, it could have been fine, but what is with all this, ""I think I want out of this life,"" stuff? It just feels wrong.Anyway, that's my only real problem with the film. It takes up too much time, is the wrong kind of emotion at the wrong point in the film, and gets cleaned up in a way that makes me think it could have been cut pretty easily in the editing bay, sacrificing one minor twist in a leadup to an ending filled with little twists.And that ending is the film at its best. It's an elaborate setup that the film has been working towards almost the entire runtime. There are unexpected little twists here and there (though, this isn't my first viewing and I remembered all of the final twists), and it's the emotional culmination of the promise of Luther's death at the beginning.It's honestly a fairly safe, star vehicle that entertains well. It's not much more than that, but that's sometimes all you really need.

A glorious re-incarnation of what, to me, looks like 30's Chicago. I'm no history scholar though and I'm sure there are anachronisms - I just don't see them.The actors are of course excellent. First we start with classy performances from Robert Redford and Paul Newman. This represents the second and final collaboration of the Hollywood legends and was even more successful than Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, picking up seven Academy Awards including Best Picture.But further down the cast list, the director (George Roy Hill) has wrung excellent performances out of his actors. Robert Shaw's actual serious knee injury is almost a character in itself. Shaw's that excellent just dormant volcano of violence that he does so well.Then the crew of con artists is brimming with good performances. Led by Ray Walston, Charles Durning and Harold Gould the ""setup"" is believable and sucks you in. Eileen Brennan is the sole serious female presence to the movie but does stand out, quietly and confidently.The comedy mostly comes from the fact that the audience are in on the ""hit"" and can see what's coming. Similar to Butch and Sundance, there are few so called jokes, it's all situational humour here.Things to look out for: a surprise assassin, the initial tap on money runner, how much work goes into the setup, ""To win???"", Robert Shaw acting his socks off with a busted leg, a pickpocket sets up a cheating poker game that sets up the big play, ""What am I supposed to do? Call him for cheating better than me?""Rating: very classy movie, very well executed, very highly recommended.",16 April 2023

Her son is cured. Although all around us we see injustice, hate, prejudices, her son is cured. We almost shout at Selma as she keeps her secret with Bill and refuses to pay the lawyer. We feel humanity has failed when so easily the jury judge her guilty, when Bill manipulates the situation with his power and influence we feel humanity has failed. So what are we to learn from this masterpiece? Sit on that. But likely that human institutional decisions don't matter. Remember at the end when they pulled the mask off Selma and someone said: 'this is highly irregular', that right there, a woman is about to die and they discuss irregularities in the death process, human institutions are so surreal.The music pieces were perfect and pulled me from the stress I would feel watching the other scenes and remind me this is a movie, I don't have to hate Bill as much as I do.Overall fantastically brave movie that couldn't be improved upon.",11 June 2023

",8,"Lars von Trier is one of the members (and one of the founders) of the Dogme movement. The Dogme movement formulated a set of rules for making film. Central theme of these rules is not making film artificial. Fond of causing consternation, with ""Dancer in the dark"" Lars von Trier made a film that is as far removed from his own rules as possible. ""Dancer in the dark"" is a musical, the most artificial of all genres.""Dancer in the dark"" (2000) is also the last film in the ""Golden heart"" trilogy, ""Breaking the waves"" (1996) and ""The idiots"" (1998) being the other two. Main character Selma (Björk) has a golden heart indeed, just as Bess (Emily Watson) has in ""Breaking the waves"". In both cases these golden hearts combine an overdosis of love and naivety.In Selma's case the love consists of saving as much as possible from her small paycheck for an operation her son needs. Her naivety helps Selma to endure the monotony of her factory job by daydreaming. In these daydreams, the machine sounds become music and Selma invents a matching choreography.In the world of Frank Capra all ends well for the good hearted but somewhat naive American (It's a wonderful life, 1946). In the world of Lars von Trier all does not end well for Selma (and not for Bess as well). Selma is swindled by Bill, a man that is as much unscrupulous as he is tragic.His tragic side reminded me of ""Ugetsu Monogatari"" (1953, Kenji Mizoguchi).

",8,"The story takes place in the United States in the 1960s and revolves around the life of Selma Jezkova (Björk), a Czech immigrant who is going blind. She works hard at a metallurgical plant in order to save money to pay for surgery for her son Gene (Vladica Kostic), who suffers from the same hereditary degenerative disease that slowly leads to the character's blindness. In a miserable reality, Selma has in Hollywood musicals her escape valve for the tragic world in which she inhabits. The protagonist lives these small moments of happiness together with her friend Kathy (Catherine Deneuve), who narrates and represents what is happening in the scenes with her fingers in the palms of Selma's hands. Between operating machines amid the noise of a metallurgical industry and saving every penny in search of healing her son, Selma flees the world in trances through the musicals that she herself plays with the help of the universe that surrounds her, and then we understand the choice from Björk to the role. The musical scenes are impeccable, it is almost unimaginable that another actress could embody Selma's personality and quirks so well, and the Icelandic woman achieves this with the greatest delivery of all of Lars Von Trier's filmography.The musical by the self-titled ""best film director in the world"" is the complete opposite of Hollywood musicals, in which ""everything ends well"". No wonder, ""Dancing in the Dark"" ends with one of the cruelest scenes that the big screen has ever shown. It is worth noting that this is a film in which Lars von Trier himself acts as camera operator, controlling the filming process in every possible scope. As an excellent director of actors, he extracts from Björk a performance that is memorable and quite improbable for a first-time actress. Together they introduce a kind of hybris to the musical genre. In ""Dancer in the Dark"", there are no outbursts of happiness, dialogues sung with enthusiasm, nor songs of easy appeal. Selma draws the motive of her music from her brutal reality. The metal sounds of the factory where she works give birth to rhythms and melodies within her and the scenes end in singing and dancing, without the color or asepsis that Hollywood studios imprinted on their productions for so long. The Icelandic woman's songs and choreographies do not have resolving or relieving power. They are always bumpy and inconclusive.Present in the vast majority of scenes, Björk manages to perfectly convey all the emotions of her protagonist's martyrdom, in her determination to enjoy every second of her life, even though her altruism and loyalty make her suffer the ills of greed and cowardice in a world cruel to which she doesn't seem - and maybe even doesn't deserve - to belong. We follow her ruin and, even knowing that the worst is yet to come, it is inevitable to root for Selma from the first sequence, with My Favorite Things, from the musical The Sound of the Music (1965), to the brutal final scenes that take place after the painful interpretation of 107 Steps. It is not by chance that the film is the portrait of Björk's own psychological exhaustion and, probably, a reflection of the very perversity with which Von Trier tortures and submits his female protagonists. The film is shrouded in controversy over allegations of sexual harassment denounced by the singer in the MeToo movement in 2017. Due to the traumas, from the recording to the release of the film, the protagonist promised that she would never act again, returning to theaters only twenty years later in ""The Northman (2022)"", directed by Robert Eggers.Understanding Lars von Trier's feature requires attention to its key moments. The strong scene in which Selma murders Bill is, above all, a brutal self-sacrifice. If Bess renounces her own body for the love of her husband in Waves of Fate, Selma renounces her own morals for the love of her son. When she strikes David Morse's character's skull, her pain is evident. More than that, it expresses an unmistakable feeling of self-destruction, as the courageous character sealed her tragic destiny there. By becoming an assassin, she chooses tragedy and death. She embraces suffering as Bess did in the first film of the trilogy, and that's exactly why both are so deeply romantic. If there is pain in the choices they make, it would be greater if they had not made them. Here is the worst condemnation for a romantic - a life made to order. Selma's dignity is in living her own torment.The scene of the confrontation between the two unfolds in a slow atmosphere of suspense that leads to the inevitable, Selma kills Bill and enters another trance, starring in one of her most peculiar delusions so far. The musical duet that unfolds between the corpse and the immigrant sounds strange, but is filled with foreboding. Everything will get worse. Even managing to flee the crime scene with the money and pay for Gene's surgery, the immigrant already had her future mapped out by misfortune, and is arrested accused of murder. The arrest took place during the rehearsal of the musical The Sound of the Music (The Sound of Music), in which she would be the protagonist. At this moment it is noticeable how everyone's behavior towards her changes. Lars Von Trier's criticism of the United States and the country's way of life is constantly put on the scene, but its apex is demonstrated in the trial of Selma, who is accused of being a cruel murderer and sympathizing with communism, due to her Czech origin. Even Selma's blindness is put in check before the jury, which sentences the immigrant to death.With the progression of blindness and alone in prison awaiting death, she can only count on the trust of Kathy and Jeff (Peter Stormare), who is in love with her. Selma accepts the implacable destiny, before her son has the chance to have the surgery. In the silent and solitary environment of the cell, Selma enters her last trance, and the saddest version ever recorded of ""My Favorite Things"", from the musical The Sound of the Music, is sung in tears by a woman who knows there is no turning back, but tries to even so, seek in his fatality the minimum of happiness. The climax of the film advances in an anguishing cloud of sadness, and despite the slightest spark of hope, which the film never creates, but which is inevitable for the viewer, we have a Selma who goes forward telling step by step her course towards gallows, and as he chants one last song, in despair, an innocent woman dies.The scene is horrifying. Björk sings at the top of her lungs ""they say this is the last song, they don't know us, you know. It's just the last song, if we let it be"" and Selma's body falls to the gallows. It is the end of a trajectory. It's a devastating ending and matches the entire aesthetic of the feature film, recorded along the lines of Dogma 95, a movement by Lars von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg. Together, they created a series of rules with the aim of producing films with as much reality as possible, avoiding the commercial aspects of productions at the time. Still talking about the soundtrack, it was carefully created and thought to link with each sequence or noise, the songs are responsible for increasing the emotional load of the scenes to high levels, capable of projecting feelings of confusion, indignation and deep sadness in the spectator. All composed by Bjork, the songs act in the film as poetry that floats in the scenes in which they are performed. With absolute certainty, it is consistent to say that the main marks of melodrama in this film are built on the fine line that separates the eccentric Bjork from Selma and in her songs interpreted in the film.It is up to the musical takes to transport us to the protagonist's hallucinations, moments that are marked by being the only ones in which we notice the cynical happiness of musicals. However, in contrast to works such as ""The Sound of the Music"" or Walt Disney classics, in this musical the way the songs are produced and presented do not completely detach us from reality, even in the midst of dances and choreographed bodies. The explanation for this lies in the Dogma 95 movement, created in 1995 by Danish filmmakers Thomas Vinterberg and Lars Von Trier.All this ugliness of the aesthetic resources used changes abruptly in the music and dance sequences (composed by Björk and choreographed by Vincent Paterson). In the train scene for example, over a hundred stationary cameras were used to capture each sequence from a variety of angles. Unlike many works that err on the side of excessive fussiness, the musical sequences that begin with the noises in the environment, such as footsteps, horns and the industrial sounds of the factories - which are very similar to the songs of the singer, instrumentalist and producer herself -, are of great importance for the development of the script, even if it has obvious flaws.Intense, deep and shocking. In ""Dancer in the Dark"" we are taken to a roller coaster of emotions, where with each ""descent"" amidst the sadness and bitterness of Selma's life, we are uncertain of emerging to good days again together with the character. Without further ado: it is a splendid film that masterfully develops the characteristics of melodrama, always knowing when to escape and revisit such aspects. Without a doubt, this is a musical to cry with sadness, the film does not have the same outlet that Selma finds in the classics. And in Lars Von Trier's filmography, the feature is one more on the list of sadisms of the director, who does not miss the opportunity to create a work with women who suffer the worst, as well as their actresses. But, despite all the controversy, it is certain that without Björk this film could never have happened, nor should it be considered, and the cathartic feeling generated by the actress's talent makes the experience of watching it, at least once, mandatory.",13 March 2023

The breakdown of innocence and the severe psychological effects of violence are expertly captured by Klimov. An immersive experience that makes the audience feel the weight of the characters' experiences is created by the use of long takes and dramatic, almost documentary-like cinematography. These are excellent performances, especially Kravchenko's. Florya's development from an innocent and idealistic youngster to a shell-shocked observer of unspeakable horrors is portrayed by the young actor with compelling effect. The vast variety of characters impacted by the war is portrayed by the supporting cast, which further enhances the film's authenticity. The film's sound design is also noteworthy; Oleg Yanchenko's eerie and moving score nicely contrasts with the austere images. The film's immersive atmosphere is enhanced, and each scene's emotional effect is amplified by the sounds of battle, ranging from distant explosions to the frightening cries of troops. It is difficult to watch Come and See (a warning) because it shows the severity of war without sugarcoating or romanticizing its atrocities. A realistic depiction of the catastrophic impact of conflict on both persons and communities is produced by Klimov's directing decisions and the film's relentless narrative.

The thread centres around the young ""Flyora"" (a superb effort from Aleksey Kravchenko) who is taken from his Belorussian family farm at gunpoint (along with anything it's possible to eat) by the invading Nazi troops. What now ensues follows this young man as he escapes his captors, finds an old rifle and determines to join up with the communists who are fighting almost insurmountable odds to thwart their encroaching, heavily armed, foe. What really resonates here is the simplicity of the production. There are no specials effects, no CGI to create many when there are few - it tells the simplest of stories in a manner that is truly brutal at times, then truly evocative at others. Man's inhumanity to man and all that - but writ large and depicting an invading army devoid of any semblance of humanity on just about every level. The experiences of this young man are truly horrific, but the presentation here is not especially graphic - though it's not for the faint hearted. We are shown what is happening, but Elem Klimov leaves plenty of scope for our own imagination to augment, if that is actually possible, the true grotesqueness of war, of random killings and destruction and all quite possibly exacerbated by the fact that the conquerors had no real idea what they were doing, or why - the film almost imbues them with the characteristics of the wildest of animals who enjoy their regime of torture and malevolence for the sake of it. The ending has a certain degree of vindication about it - but oddly enough it's not especially satisfying. The emotional exhaustion of the viewer has long since set in, and the true fate of what I can only really call these uniformed bullies is just, yet somehow inadequate. The film is gently paced, it could almost be a video diary as young ""Flyora"" meets and hides from those he encounters and we share his fears and risks en route.

",10,"Epic story from the heart of the South. The casting in particular was spot on here as was the incredible score. The cinematography, lighting, camera work, sets, locations and use of colour also play their part in making this such a memorable film.The film uses the American civil war as a back drop for the character development of a young woman who's beautiful, privileged but ultimately superficial, shallow character and world are shattered by the events of the Civil War and what follows. Unlike most of those around her Scarlett cares little for the cause, annoyed only at how rationing and war have robbed her of all the pretty clothes and men she is used to having around. However she if forced to put on a façade and conceal these aspects of her character. Scarlet has plenty of brains and ambition but again is forced to repress this side of her character too, worrying it will appear unattractive to men. She is not always entirely successful though and little flashes of hot anger appear, especially while talking with her father, a proud plain spoken Irishman who knows her only too well for her to bother trying to conceal anything from him. She is in love with Ashley Wilkes a southern who stands out for his level headedness and thoughtful, patient character, unfortunately for Scarlet he shows little interest in her which only deepens her longing for him, instead he marries his cousin. Temptation lies ahead for Scarlet in the form of the good looking Rhett Butler, a man who in many ways represents the polar opposite of the Ashley, Rhett is rude, direct, cynical and enjoys a joke at Scarlet's expense, for all his faults though Rhett see's through Scarlet with a clarity which few others do. Ashley and Rhett also share a mutual trepidation about the South's prospects of winning the civil war.The first act of the film covers the pulsing mood of optimism and overconfidence which sweeps the south at the start of the war, later to be replaced by grim determination, then finally by desperation as the North closes in around them. Scarlet travels from her childhood home and plantation Tara to the city of Atlanta only to find the union forces are closing in around it. The only way out will lie with accepting help from a man she can't stand.In the second act of the film hard times follow and it is only Scarlet's sheer determination and resourcefulness which save her family and home from ruin. Her shrewd and calculating business mind lead her into accepting another unwise marriage proposal in order to ensure Tara is able to meet it's tax requirements. Many softer characters are unable to cope or adapt to the new life, however Scarlet while suffering is able to meet the challenges ahead and at last put her mind to some practical use, she finds she has a talent for making money. The death of her mother and the premature decline in her father's facilities only push her further into the role of taking charge. Unfortunately the experiences of hunger and fear she suffers leave her mentally scarred and from now on she decides she must be hard and ruthless to ensure her future survival.The third act follows the collision of personalities between her and Rhett Butler, a dangerous scoundrel who finally proposes to her and she accepts. Her wealth and influence increases still further although much of society disapproves of a woman being so business minded and driven. Scarlet's relationship with Rhett is a fiery one, Rhett is mad with jealousy over her unrequited love towards Ashley.The acting is superb, the character development for Scarlet from spoilt child to weary survivor to a final sort of victor is quite something, though Ashley remains frustratingly out of her reach. Some of the scenes are of course now utterly iconic, the wounded soldiers, tomorrow is another day, Franky my dear.... I loved the costumes in this though, the siege of Georgia, Tara before and after. Watching this in high definition really shows off the film in it's full power.

",8,"1991's JFK is a historical epic of massive aggregate. I mean there's a lot of movie in this movie, told through the hallucinatory lens of one Oliver Stone. Sure it's over three hours long but there's never a dull moment, just shaky certitude and some probable hearsay. ""Back and to the left, back and to the left"". Uh-uh.Distributed by Warner Bros and hauntingly scored by the GOAT of musical composers (my man John Williams), JFK is not necessarily about John F. Kennedy. I mean it kind of is but it's more so about the investigation into his assassination brought by real life district attorney Jim Garrison (played with straight-faced discipline by Kevin Costner).JFK, well it's Oliver Stone in his heyday, providing the viewer with staggered editing, tons of scorching flashbacks, and grainy, accumulated archive footage that's anywhere from the late 50s to the end of the ""Swinging Sixties"". Back thirty-plus years ago, Stone was never about shooting a flick for the present day. He bled nostalgia, providing a sense of time and place that's impeccable and a shadowy set design for the ages. As Ian Anderson once quipped, ""oh, we won't give in, let's go living in the past"". Indeed.Remembrance and expansion of conscience images aside, JFK gives Stone the chance to do what he does best, squeeze great performances from actors that have never been solely Oscar types. Hey look there's Kevin Bacon killing it as broken witness Willie O'Keefe. Look there's the late John Candy killing it as well as slobbery attorney Dean Andrews Jr. And oh yeah, Brian Doyle-Murray (Bill Murray's bro) channels a solid Jack Ruby (Kennedy demise enthusiasts totally know who Jack is).Bottom line: whether you believe Stone's delirium vision of JFK or think it's just pure propaganda, what's on screen is compelling either way because of Oliver's knack for forcefully digging up American tragedies. His balls-out approach and total fearlessness here make him one of my all-time favorite filmmakers. ""Let justice be done though the heaven's fall"". Groovy man.",17 December 2023

It's based on a book written by Margaret Mitchell in 1936 and was turned into a movie directed by Victor Fleming. The movie is all about love, being strong, and dealing with tough times during a war. Many people have loved this movie for a long time, and it's considered an important part of the history of movies.The main character in the movie is Scarlett O'Hara, played by Vivien Leigh. Scarlett is a determined Southern woman who has to deal with all the troubles of the Civil War and what came after. She's strong-willed, but she can also be ruthless when it comes to protecting her family's plantation, Tara. In the movie, she has a complicated relationship with Rhett Butler, played by Clark Gable. Rhett is charming, but he can also be cynical. The movie shows how their relationship changes as the story goes on.This movie is famous for its big and impressive scenes, especially in the beginning. It shows the grandeur of Southern plantations and the beauty of the South. The movie's look was groundbreaking for its time because it used a color technology called Technicolor, which made everything look even more vivid. One of the most famous scenes in the history of movies is when Atlanta is burning. This scene shows how much effort went into making this movie.A major theme in ""Gone with the Wind"" is about change. Scarlett's character starts as a self-centered and materialistic young woman but changes as she faces the challenges of the Civil War. She becomes a survivor who can handle anything. Her character represents how the South changed because of the war. This theme meant a lot when the movie was released during the Great Depression, and it still means something to people today.The movie also looks at love in different ways. Scarlett has unrequited love for a man named Ashley Wilkes, and she has a complicated relationship with Rhett Butler. These relationships show that love can be really complicated. Rhett's famous line, ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn,"" is one of the most famous lines in movies. It shows how his relationship with Scarlett changes.""Gone with the Wind"" is also famous for how it shows the American South. It shows the beauty of the South, but it also doesn't hide the terrible parts of the Civil War. However, the movie has been criticized for not showing the history of slavery in the South accurately. It's also criticized for how it shows Black characters, which was a reflection of the time when the movie was made.Even though ""Gone with the Wind"" is loved by many, it's also important to remember that it has problems when it comes to how it shows race and the South.

As such, ""JFK"" is best seen as fiction.The story begins with the John Kennedy assassination in 1963. It then soon skips ahead a few years and you see that an FBI agent, Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) is STILL investigating the case in his spare time, as he's convinced that the timeline presented by the Warren Commission (the folks in charge of investigating the assassination) are wrong. All sorts of other accounts for the assassination are explored and given great credence...so much so that audience members will likely assume all this mumbo-jumbo is real...which it's not.So, we have a very well acted, well constructed and entertaining film...which is based on strange theories and delusions.

",7,"It's all the more fascinating to watch this again in 2021, almost sixty years on, when the office of the US Presidency is still mired in conspiracy and controversy. This film deals with Louisiana District Attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) and his almost obsessive quest to prove that the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas in 1963 was a concerted effort by rogue elements in the American establishment - government, military and industry - to avert his withdrawal from Vietnam and ensure billions of dollars continued to line the pockets of many a vested interest. Oliver Stone has amassed a creditable cast to illustrate the developing theorem postulated by Garrison - despite personal and professional threats - that proves both compelling and interesting to watch. My snag is that the hook on which much of this drama is based - the characterisation of Garrison - is really poor. Costner just doesn't deliver. He is weak and uninspiring; his impassioned search for truth and justice is set up well by the strong supporting efforts, but his on-screen persona just lacks the zeal and intensity needed to sustain the intensity of this investigation. Plaudits ought to go to an excellently enigmatic Donald Sutherland as his latter day deep throat ""X""; and to Tommy Lee Jones as the seriously seedy ""Shaw"". Kevin Bacon also performs well as the aptly named, glorified rent boy ""Willie"". Maybe it is the presence of such acting luminaries - Matthau, Lemmon and Sissy Spacek (Garrison's wife) that serve to further compound the inadequacies of the lead? A failure that is finally embodied by the missed opportunity to present his rousing denouement to an open court that is quickly reduced to something akin to a third grade chemistry lecture with little inflection or potency. It's long, at times feeling unnecessarily weighty. Perhaps, had the director not gone for a box office pappiness to head this otherwise gripping docu-dramna, then it could have been a great movie. As it is, it's good but lacking. Congress ordered an evaluation of the documents supporting/contesting these assertions in 1992 - the absence, meantime, of any further developments will ensure this film stays pertinent, however flawed, for many years to come...",26 August 2023

",6,"Let me talk about the parts of Gone With The Wind that have aged well first. This is a bonafide, epic, Hollywood classic, big budget film. The scene where Scarlet O'Hara walks among the wounded confederate soldiers alone is breathtaking. This was decades before CGI so when you realize every one of them had to be extras in costume just for that one dramatic shot, it blows you away. The cinematography is incredible and the acting, for its time, is extremely impressive as well. And there's even a bit of humor woven into the script. Not a lot, but every once in a while you get a scene that makes you smile or chuckle and you know you're watching a well written story that, at its heart, about survival at any cost.Here's what hasn't aged well. 4 hours? Seriously. A 4 hour film? Did people have nothing else to do in the 1930s? I mean, even fast forwarding through the overture, intermission and exit music it's well over 3 and a half hours. Easily an hour longer than it needed to be. But the main thing is the blatant racism. This film glorifies the antebellum south and sugarcoats slavery like it's FOX News (relax, it's a joke). For me, it's difficult to fully enjoy a movie like this knowing it only helped stereotype African Americans as an inferior race and Whites as the pinnacle of civilization, especially when you think about the fact that nothing is as uncivilized as owning another human being. I mean, there's a scene about halfway through the film where the war is over and the white people are forced to pick their own cotton, and they're all standing around complaining about how difficult the work is, and I'm screaming at my TV, ""But you had no problem forcing your slaves to do it you f%&king evil pieces of sh$t!"" And if that scene had been presented with an ounce of irony or even awareness by the filmmaker of hypocrisy I might have appreciated it. But it was not. When you refer to the union army as the ""evil aggressor"" and spend most of the movie lamenting the fact that southern charm and civilization are lost for good, you're coming down on the side of slavery and racism and that part was difficult for me to get passed.Rhett Butler's treatment of Scarlett O'Hara hasn't aged well either. Threatening a woman that you're going to crush her skull to get her to stop thinking about another man, while holding her head in a vice grip, is ugly behavior. If that's the ""civilization"" this movie celebrates than I'm glad I wasn't born a ""southern gentleman.""In the end, I admired Scarlet O'Hara. She's a tough woman and pragmatist. She will do anything to hold onto her plantation and return it to its former glory, even if that means marrying a man she doesn't love. Even in the end, her crocodile tears when Rhett is leaving her fade away when she realizes she can come up with a plan to bring him back because ""tomorrow is a new day."" That's the survival part of this movie that I appreciated and it's the movie's most redeeming quality.",29 September 2023

",7,"Disney's interpretation of C. Williams High-school football season of 1971.This is a good film elevated by the performances of the cast.'Remember the Titans' has a righteous message at heart and all people involved should be commended conveying it in an engaging way that has mass appeal.I think how well that message translates into a story is debatable. Most Hollywood movies ""based on a true story"", are generally loosely adapted with plenty of fiction included. This is not usually a problem, but the writers do it in a very simplistic and predictable way here. Some individuals for me are written quite one-dimensional, hackneyed and at times are a bit annoying. In some scenes I found myself feeling the filmmakers could have just made it a musical. At least then I would accept it's cheesiness as part of the genre.The above is my only gripe, but to keep balance, I think the story flows well and whether you like or dislike the portrayals of various individuals, I think they are entertaining. Generally the dialogue feels quite natural and suits the actors delivery.Importantly the performances of all are strong. Denzil Washington, Will Patton, Wood Harris and Ryan Hurst are particularly good. They make scenes that are written very obviously and unsubtly quite memorable and believable.Audio-visually it handles the typical sporting tropes of training montages, championship games, and rousing speeches very well.

John Rhys-Davies' Sallah was a warm character who provided some comic relief in his scenes. The major villain, Ronald Lacey's Arnold Toht, was surprisingly terrifying and I found myself quite nervous in the scenes he was in - he did a good job! The heavy action throughout the movie is enjoyable, but perhaps at the expense of a lack of character depth and emotion.I have a few qualms with the story, which is why I haven't rated it any higher. Despite being pivotal to the plot, I couldn't understand the concept of the ark and why it was perceived as important by the characters, especially as there was so much uncertainty as to what it was.

This powerful tale, directed by Boaz Yakin and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures, left an enduring impact on me from my childhood days.Watching ""Remember the Titans"" on the ABC Family channel became a cherished ritual for me.

C. Williams High School. While their journey revolves around learning mutual respect and teamwork, the film doesn't neglect the individual arcs of central characters like Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst), Julius Campbell (Wood Harris), and Petey Jones (Donald Faison). The balance struck in character development ensures that the film never loses sight of its primary goal: the team's quest for glory in the high school state championship.With a runtime of 1 hour and 53 minutes, ""Remember the Titans"" never lets the pace waver, keeping me engrossed from start to finish. Memorable scenes, like Julius Campbell's delivery of his iconic line to Gerry Bertier, ""Attitude reflects leadership, Captain,"" provided not only entertainment but also moments for reflection and real-life lessons.The film's musical score, composed by Trevor Rabin, perfectly complements the on-screen visuals, becoming a standalone piece that I've frequently enjoyed in isolation. Additionally, the carefully curated movie soundtrack featuring hits like ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough,"" ""Spirit in the Sky,"" and ""Fire and Rain"" further elevates the film's auditory experience.

At the helm is the newly appointed African-American coach, Herman Boone (Denzel Washington), who must navigate the racial tensions while uniting the team.Washington delivers a commanding performance as Coach Boone. His presence on the screen is dynamic and inspirational, successfully portraying a man who has to battle not only the rival teams but the prejudices of the society he lives in. Equally compelling is Will Patton as Coach Bill Yoast, the former head coach who becomes Boone's assistant. Their relationship is a microcosm of the film's wider themes and the chemistry between the two actors is palpable.The screenplay by Gregory Allen Howard is filled with memorable dialogue and powerful moments that highlight the struggle for racial equality. The football sequences are intense and well-executed, effectively driving the narrative and heightening the emotional stakes.However, where 'Remember the Titans' truly shines is in its handling of its subject matter. It approaches the issue of race relations head-on, and yet its message is not one of division, but unity and understanding. The film doesn't shy away from showing the ugly realities of prejudice, but it also highlights the potential for change and growth.From a technical standpoint, the film is solid. The cinematography by Philippe Rousselot captures the intensity of the football games and the quiet tension of the more dramatic scenes. The soundtrack, filled with popular music from the era, adds to the authenticity and emotional resonance of the film.In conclusion, 'Remember the Titans' is a compelling and inspirational sports drama that successfully tackles societal issues. The standout performances, particularly from Denzel Washington, coupled with a powerful script, make it a memorable film that leaves a lasting impact. It serves as a reminder of the incredible things that can be achieved when we set aside our differences and come together as a team - a lesson that is as important today as it was in 1971.",12 July 2023

",8,"A film that gave us a story packed full of action, amazing stunt work, a really imaginative production design, a fantastic score and lastly one of the greatest heroes in cinema, Indiana Jones, an archaeologist/adventurer. The film released in 1981 took inspiration from the swashbuckling 1940s/1950s era of Hollywood, in that respect the premise is simple, our hero must find the treasure, rescue the girl and save the world. The film was largely shot on location in North Africa and this adds a touch of grit and realism which really benefits the film, you see the little flies landing on the actors faces during a few close ups and see the sweat rolling off their brows. The film largely takes place in one location Egypt, with the very early part set in South and North America.The Blu Ray transfer looks really great, with lots of rich earthy colours, reds, browns, sandy yellows, greys & dark leathery brown, these tend to make up most of the costume design. The supporting cast are also very well written and good fun too, from the heroes to the villains. The tone of the film is adventurous and the pacing certainly gives the whole thing a massive injection of energy. There's a slight theme of magic v rationality, as the initially skeptical Indiana Jones is confronted with the dangerous reality of the power held within the lost ark he is seeking.There is not much in the way of character development, though the relationship between Dr Jones and the feisty and rather attractive Marion Ravenwood changes over the course of the film. The movies hail from the decade that was the 1980s and so we're given a slightly stronger female love interest than audiences were used to in the 1960s and 1970s, Marion's character shares similarities with Princess Leia in the Empire Strikes Back or Charlie Blackwood in Topgun, beautiful and alluring but also a tough-minded woman who takes no nonsense and will stand up for herself. You could certainly get away with more too in the 1980s cinema than you can today, the film features quite a lot of violence, blood and swearing for something that children were allowed to watch, I doubt a PG film today could get away with anything like this.The film's logic is not intended to be taken as 100% realistic, a main character in a realistic action film would probably die after the first 10 minutes. For this reason it's possible to overlook the numerous injuries Jones picks up which would put most people into hospital. The fact the German's had no presence in Egypt is also something you have to overlook in the film, the British in fact were in control of Egypt in 1936, it would have made more sense if the Fascists were working from Libya, but then Libya doesn't feel as Biblical as Egypt does, so I suppose the location was switched.

I still consider it as the perfect example for how a movie should be in the Adventure genre. It aged very well, I still enjoyed it like the first time. Harrison Ford is perfect in the role of Indie, makes me curious to see how he does in the latest one, as I can't see him jumping and running around anymore like he used to do. Karen Allen is eye candy. She has that innocent sexy look and is a pleasure to watch. Raiders Of The Lost Ark is already so old but still one of the better ones from the Indiana Jones franchise, and a reference for the adventurous movies.",19 December 2023

This proves to be the least of their problems when the gangsters from Chicago eventually manage to track them down...I've seen Some Like It Hot too many times to count, but it's one of those films that still rewards the viewer with each passing viewing. Although rewatching a classic is never going to quite hit home in the same way as it does on the first viewing, Some Like It Hot still has a very amusing storyline and wonderful central performances from Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon.The slightly odd thing about this film is that it is pitched as a comedy, but contains a sub-plot involving gangsters bootlegging and bumping people off in order to set up its story. In some ways it's quite dark and shouldn't really work, but in this instance it does. Even though these gangsters are meant to be ruthless mobsters, for me they never quite come across as being as cruel or as mean as they could have been; this is mostly down to the interactions and banter that is exchanged between them and the other characters. Raft is superb as Spats Columbo and Harry Wilson as his dim-witted henchman is also responsible for plenty of laughs.Monroe was famously difficult to work with on this film and her scene where she is talking to Junior on the phone where her eyes are darting around all over the place clearly show that she was reading her lines from some kind of teleprompter or autocue. Although this was a trying project for Wilder, I personally feel it was worth all the pain and anguish as the overall product here is so good and has left the world with a very satisfying and funny film.The chase sequences at the end are top drawer and the film has one of the funniest and most memorable final lines in cinema history.

We first meet him as a young man in South Africa and his anti imperialist efforts and demands for basic dignity soon take him back to India where his part political part social revolution soon starts to spread. He's presented as a slightly unworldly spiritual man but his keen sense of observation and attention to detail help him identify problems which many others simply look over. His portrayal is as one of the best types of men, of a very high moral standard yet also able to accept the human frailty in his fellow man. The film had a very healthy budget of $22,000,000, a great deal of money back in 1982. The film was shot on location in India and the picture is presented in 2.35 : 1 aspect ratio (Wide screen). The colour palette is usually rather dull for most scenes, lots of whites, browns, sandy yellows and so on. It's inside the beautiful homes and gardens of the governors and rulers of India that there's more colour allowed in the picture. Over the course of a long film Gandhi achieves his dream of a free India. He is locked up many times and often frustrates his fellow campaigners by not taking a tougher more militant stand. Gandhi however holds fast to his values and principles of action through non-violence. Not all are as admirable as him though, Muhammad Ali Jinnah is portrayed as cold and calculating, possessing a shrewd mind but a hard heart.The last part of the film is quite sad, political events begin to overtake Gandhi and he is left struggling to play catch up. India is divided against his wishes into a Hindu and a Muslim side before descending into sickening violence as neighbour turns on neighbour. Gandhi is so dismayed by what he sees and hears that he withdraws into fasting and cuts himself off. Nevertheless less his death still comes as a huge shock to the country and literally hundreds of thousands of mourners attend his funeral.",23 December 2023

Exceptional acting throughout; so many standout performances. Sir Ben Kingsley is absolutely mesmerising in his character.Cinema at its most raw and expressive and violent. There's an eruption of sheer violence as the protest escalate. Then the violence from the British. I'm aghast at the violence here from my birth country and it's so very unsporting.The upper-class Tory Government had no idea what to do with India. It shows. The empire was folding and they had no idea how to control it. It was a time for a new era.This movie portrays the transition from the old establishment towards the new era including the tragic mass-migration of religions from Pakistan to Indian and Indians to Pakistan.It is a compelling movie and a compelling part of history. Something all students should learn from. People should use empathy and dialogue before violence. Yet still in 2023 violence is still occuring. It's very sad. I think Gandhi would be appalled and dismayed if he was alive today with so many wars still happening and world leaders not doing enough for peace.This message of peace which is so prominent in this movie is something so important. This movie should be in the curriculum but is not. I wonder why? An absolutely amazing movie.

",10,"The film starts out with the scope of what Richard Attenborough is trying to accomplish:
""No man's life can be encompassed in one telling. There is no way to give each year its allotted weight, to include each event, each person who helped to shape a lifetime. What can be done is to be faithful in spirit to the court record and try to find one's way to the heart of the man...""The story begins and ends in New Delhi India 30 January 1948. From here, we flashback to Gandhi's younger days as a lawyer when he first was introduced firsthand to South Africa and its injustices. From there we follow him through his trials and tribulations in South Africa and then India. What I enjoyed about the India part of the movie was that while he was learning about India, we get to travel with him and learn about India. Gandhi leaves a message, not of nonviolence but appropriate responses and knowing that you're in control. Even though each viewer will have their ups and downs in the different parts of this movie, the two things that struck me the most was when India on the verge of independence had to split into two countries, and when Gandhi was dispatched by of all people, far right-wing, conservative Hindus.Ben Kingsley excellently plays Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi to the point that you can believe he is the real thing. However, the rest of the characters in the film have a problem with recognition to the point that you ask, ""Where have I seen that person before?"" then you can settle down again to the story. A major character that is sometimes overlooked is the soundtrack, which enhances but does not intrude on the film.

rw9459247,ur173298167,tt0083987," Gandhi more like TERRORIST
",1,"One common criticism of the ""Gandhi"" movie is its portrayal of Mahatma Gandhi as excessively saintly, almost deifying him. The film tends to focus on Gandhi's more idealized qualities, presenting him as a flawless and almost otherworldly figure. This approach has been faulted for oversimplifying his character and neglecting the complexities and contradictions within Gandhi's personality.In reality, Gandhi was a multifaceted individual with his own flaws and controversies. Critics argue that by presenting a one-dimensional, saint-like version of Gandhi, the film fails to capture the true essence of the man and his philosophy. Gandhi was known to have personal struggles, and his decisions were not always universally admired. By glossing over these aspects, the movie sacrifices a more nuanced and accurate portrayal of the historical figure.Furthermore, some critics highlight the omission of certain crucial aspects of Gandhi's life from the film. For instance, the movie downplays his interactions with other prominent leaders of the Indian independence movement, such as Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose. By narrowing its focus primarily on Gandhi, the film neglects the collaborative and collective nature of the independence movement, providing an incomplete representation of the historical context.Another significant criticism revolves around the perceived white savior narrative in the film, with Richard Attenborough, a British director, at the helm. The argument is that the movie unintentionally reinforces a colonial perspective by framing the story through the lens of a benevolent Western observer. This approach, intentionally or not, may reinforce a sense of Western superiority and diminish the agency of Indian leaders in their struggle for independence.Additionally, some critics argue that the casting choices contribute to this issue. While Ben Kingsley's performance as Gandhi received widespread acclaim, the casting of a British actor in the role of a revered Indian leader raises questions about representation. Some argue that this choice perpetuates the trend of Hollywood sidelining authentic representation in favor of star power, potentially undermining the film's cultural authenticity.In conclusion, while ""Gandhi"" received critical acclaim and won numerous awards, it is not without its share of criticisms. The oversimplified, saintly portrayal of Mahatma Gandhi, the omission of significant events and figures, and concerns about the white savior narrative have all contributed to a less-than-favorable view of the film for some viewers. Despite its cinematic achievements, the movie's approach to historical accuracy and cultural representation remains a subject of debate among critics and audiences alike.",27 November 2023
rw9429306,ur110212703,tt0083987," Hagiographic Epic
",8,"The structural similarities between Richard Attenborough's Gandhi and David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia are really quite striking. They both start with the death of their title characters, skip ahead to their funerals, and then goes back to the right before they go off on their first major entrance into the greater world. Throw in some other details (Lean had once tried to make a film about Gandhi, there are some Lean regulars in the supporting cast, Attenborough is obviously aping Lean's technical styles), and you've got Attenborough borrowing heavily from his British counterpart and predecessor to make an epic in his style. I don't think that if Lean had made the film he'd be disappointed in the work, and the only thing I feel like holds it back at all is its hagiographic treatment of its main character, though that's not surprising given that the Indian government fronted a full third of the film's budget (and probably made filming as smooth as possible).Mohandas Gandhi (Ben Kingsley) is an Indian lawyer who studied at the bar in London and is going to South Africa to help on a case, but the laws in South Africa dictate that he is a second-class citizen because of his skin. He rankles at the treatment he and his fellow Indians are receiving, and in the face of British colonial repression, he leads a movement of civil disobedience that successfully raises the legal status of Indians in the nation. Successful, he and his family go back to India where the political powers there, both in the colonial government and the Congress Party of native Indians seem to want little to do with this quiet lawyer and troublemaker.He has a bevy of support from his wife Kasturba (Rohini Hattangadi) to the Christian minister Charles Andrews (Ian Charleson) to the political leaders Nehru (Roshan Seth) to Patel (Saeed Jeffrey) to Muhammad Ali Jinnah (Alyque Padamsee). This support is all done in the face of the British government's efforts to retain its holdings on India as a part of the empire, and Gandhi's efforts to fight without bloodshed have the effects he desires as well as some that he does not predict, mostly in some of the worst excesses of both sides. The one event that gets serious attention, though is the massacre orchestrated by Brigadier General Dyer (Edward Fox) that kills hundreds of unarmed civilians in a place where they could not escape.These sorts of events are things that Gandhi never wants, probably expects, and leans into in order to build his movement, hold back the violent tendencies of those in the Independence movement, and guilt the British into their negative treatment of India's people. He stages other events like the burning of British made clothes and the famous march to the sea. Gandhi's practices get shown in their best light and given the most effective treatment (though how much Gandhi played in the actual Independence movement may be up for a bit of debate), and Gandhi is almost never less than a walking saint.And that's where the film feels a bit off to me. It's not enough to derail much, but Gandhi has pretty much no faults in this film, and it ends up feeling unnatural. He's too good, too pure, and too dedicated. Contrasting to the character of TE Lawrence in Lean's film is interesting because Lawrence was a madman as shown in the film, and Gandhi could have been presented in a similar way. A man of vision that he almost achieves before the real world comes crashing in on him. That does sort of happen, where I think Lean would have gone further with the story in those final thirty minutes or so. The difference is that Lawrence is seen as a man disconnected from the real world while Gandhi is presented as the man connected to the truth that the rest of the world can't see. They're both ultimately utopians trying to impose their vision on the world that cannot adhere to it. I can see why Lean would have been attracted to the subject.That's not to say that Gandhi was a bad man or even insane or anything, just that his vision of the world, as presented in the film, was ultimately unworkable. He decided that certain differences that separated the 300,000,000 Indians were simply not important, and they needed to all fall in line behind that. That's asking a lot, and his vision needs those 300,000,000 to maintain that forever. That disconnect with how the real world works is an extension of his original vision of an India without British rule. No one thought that could happen, and he pushed until it did, but that didn't require a complete overturning of human nature from an entire nation. They had to remain in solidarity against a common enemy while he had to go on extended fasts to get them to minimize their worst impulses.And the film's treatment of him as simply a great man without flaw kind of glosses over all of this, providing us a slightly less interesting picture of a man that the world just can't keep up with.That's not to imply the film is bad in any way. It's very good. The portrait of Gandhi as a man and character may be sanded down to the smoothest of images, but he's still an interesting saint of a man while the recreation of the era on the grand scale that the Indian government helped provide. Kingsley is great in the role, and he's surrounded by accomplished actors who help him at the same time.Attenborough handsomely films everything while getting quality performances from everyone while the script by John Briley just pulls its punches when it comes to Gandhi as a character, probably afraid of angering the Indian government with a less than saintly portrait of their national hero. It's understandable, but I think there were depths to be mined with a less sanded over portrait of the man.",12 November 2023

There were so many laugh out loud moments placed abundantly throughout the film and when it eventually slips into a more serious tone, it feels so natural. The change in mood was so seamless that I didn't even consciously realise the moment that it transitioned!

Plus, it somehow manages to explore themes such as gender, sexuality, femininity, and even perversion, all in a 1950s comedy! It took me by immense surprise to see such a revolutionary & progressive film coming from such a conservative era. But regardless, this film wouldn't be what it is if it wasn't for the tremendously outstanding performances of Tony Curtis (as Joe/Josephine) and Jack Lemmon (as Jerry/Daphne). It genuinely shocks me that the former was *not* in the run-in for an Oscar (unlike his co-star), as they were almost equally as exceptional as each other. I say almost simply because Lemmon had that slight edge to him, and that was mainly thanks to the extremely wide range of emotions that his character goes through, and as a result, we got to see his acting prowess on show in all sorts of extravagantly various ways. Finally, I'd just like to mention the very thing that this movie won an Academy Award for: the costume design. This, together with the hair & make-up, was nothing short of excellent.

This one also starts off with the same premise but some like it hot did it first and that too more than 7 decades ago. The story in itself was pretty good with excellent acting especially by Jack Lemmon, he nailed it. His expressions, his feminine voice and that dance he did. The chemistry between both the main leads was amazing. The dialogues especially between those two were really good. It was a innocent, comedy and romantic movie and I personally enjoyed every second of it. And damn Marilyn was just mesmerizing. I highly recommend it if you haven't seen it love this movie.Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis dressed up are perfectly fit in their ""new lives"". Their voices put me over the top. Joe E.

rw9046206,ur3914439,tt0053291," Dragged a bit
",6,"""Some Like It Hot"" is an American (mostly) comedy live action film from 1959, so this one will have its 65th anniversary next year or maybe it happened already depending on when you read this review of mine. I can imagine that for this anniversary the film will be shown again on the big screen at many movie theaters, but I myself had the chance to see it on the occasion of a currently-running Marilyn Monroe retrospective and I went for it and do not really regret going, even if I cannot share the gigantic praise this film has received in the decades since its production. I think some call it the best comedy ever made, but there is no way I would agree there and the inclusion of the film in the top-250 highest-rated-movies list on the renowned imdb website I cannot support either, especially as it is not only barely hanging in there, but still almost in the first halt at this point. This is a black-and-white movie which surprises me a bit because of the colorful film poster that features all three protagonists, but we will get to those a little later. And also a bit unusual because (Monroe) comedies from those days were usually in color. The film is not only adored by many still today, but was already one of the big awards players back then. It won the Oscar for costume design, one of three Oscars Orry-Kelly won out of only four nominations, impressive even more so because he stood at 3/3 for quite some time. He was already over the age of 60 when he worked on this one and death was sadly just five years away. Very interesting biography too. There is as much behind this unusual name as you could think. But let's not make this about him only. Cinematographer Charles Lang also scored one of his double-digit Oscar nominations that happened in five different decades, but won only once. Art directors Haworth and Boyle had just won their (only) Oscars in the years before this film and managed to sneak in again too. And Billy Wilder of course, well his history with the Academy was one of a kind and here he managed two nominations too for this film, even if he could not win any.On the acting side, Jack Lemmon, who reminded me so much of Stan Laurel here at times, got a nomination in the lead actor category and I would say that I did not feel his performance was this magnificent to justify the honor, but if we look at him winning the BAFTA and Golden Globe for his portrayal here, he was probably closer to winning the Oscar too than to not being nominated. I like the actor, but he had won one already with his first nomination (this being the second) and he was bound to win another and that is enough I suppose. Marilyn Monroe by the way not nominated for a BAFTA here, which felt a bit surprising maybe because they liked her more than most other awards bodies, but she did win the Golden Globe, one of her biggest career triumphs. The Oscar nomination was not meant for her, mostly because of her untimely death not many years after this movie here. And finally, the last from the trio is Tony Curtis and I am surprised that he did not score any awards attention at all, or almost none except here in my country Germany a little bit. Compared to how much the other two scored, he deserved better, even if it had been nominations only. Maybe it had to do with him getting his (first and only) Oscar nomination the year before. Enough with the awards now and let's look at the film at hand here, the plot and characters a little bit and some of the actors too. There is not too much to say about the rest of the cast I suppose. The one exception I have to mention is maybe Nehemiah Persoff. He died last year only and this means he became a centenarian and not just by a few days. I think he was the one holding the speech from the elevated group of bad guys towards the end that stood way above the initial antagonists even, so you can say that by leading this elite group he exceeded them all already back then, just like he would later on age-wise.Speaking of older actors, Joe E. Brown was really funny to watch here at times and had great recognition value as always with his face mostly and I am sure that many who adore this film (more than I do) will remember his character having the last words of the movie, a pretty memorable quote in its context there that can also be seen as a statement of tolerance by today's standards I suppose. The strong contrast to this statement is maybe one from Lemmon's character it was from much earlier when he elaborated on this situation there that had a slightly homosexual tone to it and he asked literally I think why a man would want to marry another man and that this does not make any sense. Times sure have changed and almost everybody had to grin in the audience when these words came out of his mouth. But yeah, I was talking about the cast here of course and I 100% have to mention Al Breneman too and he played the hotel employee, the bellhop who was quite a player when it comes to women and had an (unrequited) love interest in Lemmon's character while the latter was in drag. He was funny, also his comment that he has a key anyway, so ""she"" does not need to let him in. It is a bit creepy by today's standards maybe, but yeah today a lot is creepy what was just funny back then, so never mind. I find it outrageous how Breneman apparently was not credited back then with this movie. Awful decision and maybe age-related discrimination. All the gangster actors were included. He would have deserved it and I am glad to see he is now still alive as he was quite young back then. The big movie career did not follow despite a film like this in his body of work when he was not even 20 and his career was over two years later already, but he is in his early/mid 80s now with everybody else from the film long gone and I hope he has a few more good years left. Actually, according to imdb, he never acted in another film again, he only had two television series credits before that and another two television series credits after that.In theory, you can say that this is a fairly serious film given the premise of two guys on the run from professional gangsters here who want to kill them as fast as they can. And as these gangsters literally shoot a bunch of guys early on, even if we do not see the corpses, it is also not a harmless movie. These gangsters then get their own punishment for being so incompetent towards the end when they are shot themselves through a surprise birthday cake there. I found it one of the funniest moments how our two heroes than again end up in a situation where they are witness to multiple murders and the bad guys want to eliminate them. In general, I found most of the jokes that did not have to do with the drag aspect here funnier than those that had to do with it. The quote from the bad guy about how he was with the leader of the bad guys, his alibi if you wanna say so, was hilarious too because of how unnecessary it was this very moment. Or yeah, if it has to be drag-related, then maybe really the ""romance"" story with Curtis' character was funnier than the one with Lemmon's character for me, even if it did not have Monroe in it. By the way, the scene in which she says early on that she is more on the dumb site was almost in a sad way something that represented a lot how she was seen in Hollywood, herself the actress and not the character she was playing. But yeah, this was or still is kinda her defining movie and I would not say her character here is as memorable as I would have liked her to be. The scene when she sang on stage topped everything perhaps and even this music number was not as good for me as a song from another film she made where she also got misled by the male protagonist (French actor who played a rich dude pretending to be poor, so exactly the other way around compared to here). That film had an awesome song at the beginning there.But back to this one here before the review ends, what else can I say? The metaphor of throwing the paddles away or what it was early on when one of the two guys had the idea to do some betting and risk the coat that kept them war during the cold winter stayed in the mind too. Nice analogy. The very final quote I already mentioned. Really memorable. Little Bonaparte (Persoff) elaborating on amateurism I already mentioned as well. This film is maybe also interesting to see from a perspective of how they elaborated on several defining issues of its time, like the role of alcohol. How it is disguised as coffee and all kinds of stuff at the beginning and the dude who was really drunk already there was kinda memorable too, even if I did not find him too funny maybe compared to others, not sure if he was funny enough to be brought back then, but well it was just at the start anyway and not later on anymore. The story moved to another state anyway, so it would not have made sense at all I suppose. Huge coincidence already that the bad guys from the beginning show up there. Oh and some cop or police inspector was around as well, but felt just for the sake of it. He even followed the bad guys in the end apparently waiting for them to make a mistake, so he was maybe a bit obsessed, but he added nothing to the story at all. I liked the bad guy's ""dig 'em up"" words though in this final conversation between the two and the brute henchman was also always hilarious and the police man actor was still good and turned the almost nothing he had to work with into something solid. He had some funny moments too on other occasions. So you see I am drifting away again from the drag action in here and I am not surprised, but it is fairly telling because it happens even with the aforementioned crime element being totally forgotten for over an hour, almost 1.5 hours if we ignore the film's framework at the beginning and end. It was just never crucial to me. The film I overall give a thumbs-up and positive recommendation, even if it is not a must-see by any means.",10 May 2023

",9,"Richard Attenborough's epic biographical film ""Gandhi"" is a sweeping and emotionally resonant portrayal of one of the most iconic figures in modern history, Mahatma Gandhi. Released in 1982, this film masterfully captures the life, philosophy, and struggle of the man who led India to independence through non-violent civil disobedience. With its stellar performances, captivating storytelling, and breathtaking cinematography, ""Gandhi"" is a timeless cinematic masterpiece that continues to inspire and educate audiences around the world.The film opens with the assassination of Gandhi in 1948, creating an immediate sense of intrigue and urgency. From this powerful beginning, the narrative takes us on a journey through the key moments in Gandhi's life, from his early experiences in South Africa, where he first developed his philosophy of non-violence, to his return to India and leadership in the fight for independence against British colonial rule.Attenborough's direction is commendable, as he skillfully balances the grand historical scope of Gandhi's life with intimate, character-driven storytelling. Ben Kingsley delivers a tour de force performance as the titular character, capturing the essence of Gandhi's charisma, wisdom, and unwavering commitment to his principles. Kingsley's transformation into Gandhi, both physically and spiritually, is nothing short of remarkable, earning him a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Actor.The supporting cast is equally impressive. John Gielgud, as Lord Irwin, and Edward Fox, as General Dyer, provide convincing portrayals of the British officials who opposed Gandhi's movement. Rohini Hattangadi, as Kasturba Gandhi, Gandhi's wife, delivers a poignant performance, showcasing the personal sacrifices made by those closest to him. The ensemble cast effectively conveys the diversity of characters and viewpoints that Gandhi encountered throughout his life.One of the film's strengths lies in its meticulous attention to historical accuracy. The production team went to great lengths to recreate the settings, costumes, and atmosphere of the time, which immerses the audience in the India of the early 20th century. This commitment to authenticity extends to the use of actual locations, such as Gandhi's ashrams and the Jallianwala Bagh massacre site, further enhancing the film's historical realism.The heart of ""Gandhi"" lies in its exploration of Gandhi's philosophy of non-violence and civil disobedience. Attenborough's screenplay delves deep into the complexities of these principles, showing how they evolved and were applied in various situations. The film effectively conveys the power of peaceful protest through memorable scenes, such as the Salt March and the fasting protests. These sequences not only showcase the strength of Gandhi's convictions but also highlight the brutality and injustice of the British colonial regime.The film also touches on Gandhi's personal struggles, including his relationship with his family and his commitment to celibacy. These moments add depth to his character and humanize him, reminding viewers that he was not just a political icon but also a man with flaws and doubts.The cinematography by Billy Williams is breathtaking, capturing the stunning landscapes of India and South Africa. The film's visual grandeur is particularly evident in its depiction of mass gatherings and protests, which are both awe-inspiring and emotionally charged. The use of natural light and the framing of iconic images, such as Gandhi's silhouette against the sun, contribute to the film's visual poetry.Ravi Shankar's evocative score complements the narrative beautifully, adding emotional depth to key scenes. The music, infused with Indian classical elements, enhances the film's cultural authenticity and emotional resonance.""Gandhi"" is a cinematic triumph that pays homage to the life and legacy of one of history's most influential figures. Richard Attenborough's direction, Ben Kingsley's unforgettable performance, and the film's dedication to historical accuracy combine to create an enduring masterpiece. Beyond its artistic merits, ""Gandhi"" serves as a powerful reminder of the enduring relevance of Gandhi's message of non-violence, justice, and human rights. It continues to inspire viewers worldwide, making it a timeless classic that should be celebrated for generations to come.",8 September 2023

The acting is superb, and both Laughton and Lanchester excel as a real life couple; Laughton laying down the law as it were, and Lanchester as his feisty nurse. No real spoiler to say that he has had a heart attack and she lovingly puts up with his tantrums. Not since ' The Bride of Frankenstein ' has Elsa Lanchester given such a memorable performance. As for Tyrone Power on trial for murder he looks tired and old but is solid in his role. Marlene Dietrich is Marlene Dietrich and despite a misplaced song in the ruins of Berlin, and an equally unlikely love scene she gives her all, which is quite demanding. She even transforms herself into another person and that is quite a feat as the German accent has to go. Along with Elsa she steals the film. As for the story the surprises come and go like clockwork. The morbidity of the impending gallows leaves a nasty taste in the mouth, and the mob in the gallery watching the trial comes across with depressing accuracy. An execution has to happen and no spoilers but the baying audience in the 1950's need to see it come hell or high water. The ending which we are crassly told must not be revealed is of course aimed at the audience's satisfaction. The mob in the gallery have to be satisfied in the Upper Circle and the stalls. Based on an Agatha Christie play the scenario is typical of its era of suspicion and imprisonments, and as long as you can accept the fantasy of crime and often unjust punishment this is an excellent film.

rw9537410,ur2863499,tt0964517," Elevated by an audacious, incomparable performance by Christian Bale
",8,"Films about boxing have always been Hollywood and Oscar favourites, and not without reason. When they are done right, the nature of the sport and the fighters' often tumultuous social backgrounds provide perfect basis for an aptly sentimental dramaturgy. Rocky, The Champ, Raging Bull, Million Dollar Baby and Cinderella Man (among others) all share these traits, and David O. Russell's The Fighter, about the boxing half-brothers Micky Ward and Dicky Eklund, is no exception. Here is a reticent, simple-minded protagonist, a rise from the slum and into stardom, and - of course - the customary training montage.The execution and plot is just as effective in The Fighter as it was in films such as Rocky or Cinderella Man, because the story, the characters, and the relation between them are all interestingly written and portrayed. In The Fighter, Micky Ward, the title character, must liberate himself from his controlling mother and underachieving brother in order to find success, without sacrificing his profound love for his family. It's a warm and nuanced portrait of values and belonging, even if the characters in question rarely share this warmth or nuanced view.What The Fighter has in addition to all the familiar qualities, is an audacious, incomparable performance by Christian Bale. Yet again Bale goes to great lengths physically in order to indulge himself in the part, among other things sporting a bald spot and losing considerable weight in order to look as a crack addict. But what's just as impressive is his complete delve into the character of Dicky Eklund, and the almost unrecognizable mannerisms and speech he creates. At last, Bale got his Oscar nomination, and I would be surprised if he didn't win. The other performers also do very well, including Wahlberg's sympathetic leading role, Amy Adams fiery performance as his girlfriend, and Melissa Leo as the matriarch - a role reminiscent of fellow Academy Award nominee Jacki Weaver's part in Animal Kingdom.The Fighter uses the 'based on a true story' label to full effect, picking and choosing those events from Micky Wards career which presumably will make the best film. It plays the sentimental note rather shamelessly in this and other manners, even concluding with some real-life footage of the brothers during the end credits. This is not criticism, however, because as long as it's done for the sake of good, classic storytelling, I'm all for it.

It took me nearly 3 decades to get myself to watch it because I still hadn't gotten over his death. I mention this because it affected my perception of the film.I first saw it in 2020 when I was going through some tough times. A close friend of mine had it on his ""must see at Christmas"" list every year so I finally agreed to watch it. I was immediately taken back to those days and months after Mr. Henson's passing, when I was only 13. But this time, instead of denial, I saw a charming love letter to the man who helped shape my childhood. I couldn't have been happier to see that his legacy lived on.Now, moving on to the movie itself, I found it to be cleverly scripted, brilliantly acted by both the human performers, and the muppet performers, and enhanced by some very catchy and meaningful songs. The story is told in the familiar fashion that most people know but with moments of absurdity and silliness that help lighten the mood, but still highlight one troubled man's path toward redemption.It is often forgotten that one cannot define a person by their actions alone. Scrooge's nephew continues to speak of the good that must be bubbling beneath the surface. As the past and present spirits reveal the true reasons behind his misery and foul demeanor, the viewer may change their thoughts on the man. Redemption is potentially possible once the pain is revealed and set free. In this situation, I am happy to see the change in him.It's a cute movie with muppets, but it tells the story well, and I feel it is a fair movie to watch with children. Open discussion on the themes can be helpful in reminding them that what's on the surface may be hiding a pain that one knows nothing about. Be kind to one another. And Merry Christmas.",27 December 2023

I think the director's contribution in this regard is huge; filming the movie with images specific to that era to reflect the boxing matches of the time made the film much more original, truly commendable.Another aspect is the acting. Everyone is really above average, but there is one name that is amazing - Christian Bale. He truly deserved the Oscar with an extraordinary performance, he is a great actor.I know there are some shortcomings in reflecting the truth in the film, as far as I know, but even if some details are overlooked, the film is so enjoyable that it makes you forget all of them. This is the main reason why I give it an 8/10 rating.This film could have been shot in a more dramatic way, telling more about the family's inner structure; maybe it would have been a much better movie, but it could never have been made as entertaining as it is now. Everything in a sports movie is there, it is a perfect evening movie, and a good recommendation.While watching the movie, you won't realize how time passes, I don't think you'll be doing anything else for a moment.

I generally watch it at some point over Christmas, and I think if anything familiarity has obscured the fact that it is just not a very good idea. The incorporation of existing Muppet characters into the story has only limited success, and sometimes the attempt is jarring. The use of Gonzo to link it, with Rizzo the rat (not previously an important character), is downright awkward. The landscapes look more like America than Britain, and some of the accents are distinctly hokey. Paul Williams' numbers are not the strongest, and even Scrooge himself, Michael Caine, doesn't compare well to the many great previous performances. Caine is okay as long as he can underplay - when he tries to emote, it's not a good look.But it is fun, certainly a helluva lot better than Muppet Treasure Island.

The film shows the Stasi agent reading Brecht as though it was illicit literature, but Brecht, who famously supported the crackdown of early protests in the GDR, would have been widely available. East Germany wasn't devoid of art. A key moment is the Stasi agent hearing Beethoven played on the piano and being moved to tears, but classical music would have been more common in socialist countries than in the West!It's pompous and naive to portray art as having the power to overthrow authoritarianism. This is exacerbated by the brief theatre scenes which, while evocative of the theatre, are reminiscent of the type of student dramatics that only the players ever enjoy. The idea that cryptic messages in theatre was the frontline of the resistance is just pathetic.Someone made the point in a six-star review here that our hero, the agent, is not moved to intervene by recognising the humanity of the people he's surveilling but instead because of his reaction to art. The final minutes of the film show the playwright on the verge of introducing himself to the agent but who instead goes and writes a novel dedicated to the agent, eschewing human contact.

Here it was the case, but the film did not get nominated in that category, but did get in in the animated feature category back then where it did not really stand a chance against the eventual winner ""Ratatouille"", another France-inspired film, one with a much less serious background though. Interestingly enough, at the Golden Globes the film got nominated in the foreign language category and at the BAFTAs even for foreign language and animation. So, it was a constant back and forth you can say, but the makers surely will not be said about any nominations the film missed out on as it won 30 awards according to imdb and was nominated for another 60 roughly, which means that the movie scored almost 100 nominations in total back in 2007/2008. Not too shabby. The makers I am referring to here are Vincent Paronnaud and Marjane Satrapi. Paronnaud has been relatively prolific in the years since then, but this is definitely still his biggest success and maybe it will stay that way forever. We will see. As for Satrapi, it is her story. She was born in Iran, left the country as a child when her parents were worried about her behavior that it may be too much against the people ruling the country at that point, so she left to Vienna in Austria at a young age, but after several years there she eventually returned.This film here takes place during the 1970s and 1980s and it is by the way not a very long film, only runs for slightly over 1.5 hours and this includes the closing credits already. Still this running time does not mean that it is animation for kids. Quite the opposite really. This rather falls into the category of ""Waltz with Bashir"", the film that most people think of when they hear ""animation for grown-ups"" and of course I do not mean adult material there or so. Just serious stories that are not suitable for kids because of certain aspects depicted. One example would be the idea of executions taking place in Iran and not just a dozen, but hundreds, more likely thousands and those executed were people who were against the system. Openly or in secret. Or maybe even those where they suspected they were against the system. This is why the girl's behavior could have turned into a problem and her parents sent her away to another country, to friends actually, but she did not stay for long with them, but had all kinds of homes then until she even became homeless and almost died and then she returned home to Iran. Where things weren't really any better compared to when she left because of her preference for ABBA, The Bee Gees, Iron Maiden and jackets that state she likes punk. We also understand where she got some of her rebellious behavior from when we see this one scene in which her mother is insulted by a random man out in the street. This was a very serious moment, but the end with the smoke cloud into the man's face was at the same time an example of how here and they also included a solid amount of comedy, so you will smile on some occasion without really neglecting the key story. The comedy aspect is completely supporting. What stayed in the mind for me the most was maybe the ""Eye of the Tiger"" music scene there simply because I adore the song and there was also a funny moment for example with all this hair on her legs, even if this was rather a contender for my least favorite moment. Or the splits afterwards that do not go so well.There are many other moments that will make you smile. Maybe girls even like that one. But I found it more memorable how she elaborates on her physical transformation, how one character talked about Japanese culture (I hope nobody found this racist or offensive) and there are quite a few other moments I could mention. I also really liked the innocence depicted especially at the very start where the protagonist was still very young, so the child aspects in her behavior and the surprise how she sees the world were clearly dominant, like also when one character tells her a story she must not forget and how she reacts there that she is in awe and said she will remember all of it for sure. This was also a bit of a tragic scene because the character there, I am not sure if it was her uncle or a family friend or whoever he was, also got executed not much later. I thought he was among the most memorable despite the limited screen time. A female character with beautifully interesting garments got executed later on too, but we did not find out too much about her sadly. As for the guy I just mentioned, he was a perfect example how there is not only black-and-white in this society. He was already an enemy of the one who ruled Iran before the power shift, but the following rulers made it even more difficult for him and he did not only end lose his freedom there, but even lost his life.Speaking of black-and-white, the fact that this documentary is almost entirely in black-and-white is another factor why this is a film for grown-ups. It is not about visually beautiful scenes or actually there are visually beautiful scenes in their own right, but they are not about mesmerizing creatures, animals etc., but rather about the entire atmosphere instead. I did not really understand why here and there they used color, but I think in a way it had to do with the protagonist feeling joy and curiosity when she discovered something new, something she had never seen before, even if this is also only partially true because, even if she found friends and lovers in Austria, it was no wonderland for her or anything and so it was not a huge surprise that she ended up home again at some point. Maybe the closest to perfection for her was France where she then went around the time when the film already ends, but as I stated when talking about this being a French co-production mostly in the French language, this may be the place where she belongs. I liked this film overall. I would not say it was absolutely overwhelmingly good and I probably would not have cheered for it hard during Oscar night if I had followed the Academy Awards back then as much as I do now, but there was never any doubt that I would give this film a thumbs-up and positive recommendation. There aren't really any weaknesses, but definitely more than just a handful good moments. Aside from that, this film is a valuable history lesson as well. Sadly things nowadays in 2023 do not look a whole lot different compared to the events and times depicted in this movie. I am sure that many people who give this a watch will also remember the protagonist's grandmother, who was by the way voiced in the original by Danielle Darrieux who was already 90 at that point and made it to 100 even. This film was among her last works. In general, you find interesting names here, with the English-language version anyway, but also the French version. Catherine Deneuve is considered an icon by many. Chiara Mastroianni has more to offer than good looks and a fantastic name and Simon Abkarian was a good choice too and he resembles his character quite a bit.I watched the German dub tonight and there the voice actors did fine as well. Jasmin Tabatabai was one of them and she was also a guest for this screening and with her own Iranian background and similar story like Satarpi's this is of course a film close to her heart as you could tell. I have to say I do not think too much of her as an actress, but with her voice acting here and also her words afterwards she won me over a bit. On a more general note again, this film goes is based on a comic release, which is a background you do not hear too often as the basis for a film, but probably more often for animated movies than others. If you think that Satrapi is only a director (and writer) here because of this being her story, you are wrong. This was her first film, but she worked on several other movies behind the camera afterwards, sometimes in both aforementioned departments, but most recently only as the director. She is also still easily under the age of 60 now, so more films can happen, maybe again with Paronnaud as this movie here was not the only time for them to collaborate. She has also published many more comic strips and according to Tabatabai those are good and funny, so who knows maybe some others of those will be turned into movies one day. I am sure Hollywood these days would love Satrapi's background story. If that is a good thing though? Debatable. Before I end the review, I return to this film here: There are many other scenes and inclusions that deserve elaboration, like how God is depicted here, but I cannot go into detail about every single one, so I just get back to the main character's transformation on one occasion because this is not just relevant for the story as she turns into a woman at that point, but it was also a great inclusion in terms of animator creativity. Look at how they exaggerate the ways in which her body changes before they include all transformations with the final product in a more subtle manner. This was really smart and funny. The film has more of this to offer. It was a success without a doubt and I am glad it managed to score an Oscar nomination. Not a given if we look at the origin and subject here, but the film drew some much-needed attention to a subject that must not be forgotten. Not be ignored. I think you should give ""Persepolis"" a watch. You will not regret it and I am surely glad I went to see this today on a one-time occasion where it was shown again in the big screen.",3 March 2023

",10,"I didn't live in the GDR, but I have experienced similar crisis of consciousness and it's difficult particularly when the system is designed to make it impossible to resist. The film has many tropes, but they are all excellently done: The spy master, the amoral boss, the noble, handsome playwright, and the pretty actress. The cinematography is first rate. I still struggle to digest the film emotionally, which is a good thing. The cold war, like WWII, was a time of tremendous upheaval and after generations, there's a fear that we'll forget out what happened and how significant it all was particularly as this generation undergoes their own crisis of conscience. When the right thing needs to be done, will you do it? Can you live with yourself?Regarding entertainment: For the most part, the film delivers. A bit slow in the middle, it happens, but this is necessary for the plot. The characters are all relatable although deliberately obvious, which is actually a good thing and adds to the layering of their actions. There's details abound including the various actions of EVERY character in the film, no matter minor. A wonderful film I could watch again.I have a dear friend from the GDR who is about to pass away.

",5,"Saturday afternoon. I chose this autobiographical movie ""Persepolis"" because I would like to watch European animated films once in a while.The film is based on a graphic book. I have not read the book yet, but from what I can see on the Amazon page, the film is faithful to the original illustration.My preconception was that since the film was set in the Iran revolution era of the 1970s, produced by France, I expected that there would be some discriminatory elements. My prediction came true.The first is a scene where a school teacher tears up a textbook, the second is a scene describing God, the third is a scene where grapes are crushed in a bathtub, and the fourth is a scene where a Japanese man in movie ""Godzilla"" were cursed for cutting stomach open. I do not know if the same expressions are used in the original book, but these scenes should have been cut as they offended the people to watch.The concept of this film that I realized is the message that ""different cultures do not coexist"". People have their own national, regional, and local cultures, where multiple cultures coexist cannot be realized.The message I got from this film can be summed up in this. In fact, the protagonist's grandmother said, ""Under the current situation in Iran, you should not go back,"" but in the end, her granddaughter decided to go to Iran.Multicultural coexistence is a pipe dream.So, overall, I give this movie 5 stars because it had both good and bad parts.",22 January 2023
rw9049829,ur160914527,tt0405094," A film Orwell would have appreciated.
",10,"As the 21st century has entered its young adulthood, I'm going to go out on a limb and state that THE LIVES OF OTHERS is the second best movie of the the millennium so far, behind the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy ~I count all three as one. Putting it succinctly, it's one of the most emotionally shattering motion pictures I've seen in a long, long time. THE LIVES OF OTHERS was the feature directorial debut of Florian Henckle von Hammersmarck, and he joins Orson Welles and Mike Nichols in that rarefied group that hit a grand slam on their first cinematic at-bat.Baseball metaphor aside, I should preface by writing that THE LIVES OF OTHERS isn't a feel-good movie. This is a story that takes place in 1980's East Germany, not exactly location that conjures up images of glamour. Of all the Iron Curtain countries during the Cold War, East Germany was by far the most oppressive, the very totalitarian nation-state George Orwell cautioned us about.East Germany's thought police was the Stasi, the state security institution that kept tabs on everyone in the country. Criticism was never permitted....unless it was directed against the West. No one was even allowed to joke about life in the Soviet blocs, something that one low level employee discovers the hard way. The Stasi conducted surveillance on anyone and everyone they deemed the slightest bit subversive, and would intimidate people into becoming informers. Friends turned on friends, neighbors turned on neighbors, spouses turned on spouses. The fallout for those betrayals continued long after the Berlin Wall came down.THE LIVES OF OTHERS is blessed with three well-fleshed-out characters. The first is Georg Dreyman, East Germany's most celebrated playwright, an artist loyal to the state that nurtured his talents, and is considered virtually untouchable. Dreyman is so highly esteemed in his profession that he's on a first name basis with First Lady Mrs Honecker.The second character is Dreyman's girlfriend Christa-Maria, the leading actress in his plays. Like most artists who believe that narcotics and/or alcohol is the fuel to their creative process, she conceals a secret drug addiction that could derail her if it ever came to light.The third person is Captain Gerd Wiesler, a Stasi interrogator considered by some to be the finest in his field. An expert in breaking down suspects, he also teaches classes on the subject and makes a note of any student who questions the method's morality. Outside of his work, Wiesler's personal life is nonexistent and somewhat bleak, much like the country he serves so staunchly. His only form of recreation comes courtesy of a prostitute whose clientele consists of similar Communist apparatchiks.The odious Minister of Culture, Bruno Hempf ~think of an Eastern bloc Harvey Weinstein~ is a powerful bureaucrat who has amorous designs on Christa-Maria, and plots to have Dreyman removed from her life. Knowing how well regarded Dreyman is in East Germany, Hempf secretly orders that the playwright be placed under 24 hour surveillance in the hope that something of a seditious nature pops up. Assigned to conduct the dirty deed is Gerd Wiesler, who has Dreyman's apartment wiretapped and personally takes the midnight shift across the street, listening in on the couple's intimate moments.The impatient Hempf isn't content to wait for Georg to slip up; he openly forces Christa-Maria to perform intercourse on him in the back seat of his car. Guilt ridden over being sexually assaulted, she tries her best to keep her boyfriend from finding out, but her behavior is already planting seeds of suspicion. Throughout the assignment, Wiesler finds himself unexpectedly becoming a part of his subjects' lives, ultimately coming to respect their humility and their humanity.Georg's moral compass is put to the ultimate test when he's notified about the suicide of his favorite director, a man who had been blacklisted by the state for perceived criticisms. Discovering cracks in the only political system he has ever known, Dreyman plans to surreptitiously write a scathing article about life behind the Iron Curtain which a colleague from West Germany will smuggle out.When the article is finally published in Der Spiegel, the East German government furiously responds by ordering the Stasi to find the phantom author. Dreyman took considerable measures to conceal his authorship by using an unregistered typewriter and keeping it hidden underneath a floorboard. To further protect Christa-Maria, he kept her completely in the dark. But in the privacy of his apartment, Georg makes some unfortunate faux pas which were overhead by Wiesler. The Stasi captain's crisis of loyalties becomes the moral fulcrum of THE LIVES OF OTHERS.When you're watching THE LIVES OF OTHERS, don't look for any extraneous action sequences to keep your attention riveted. The plot moves along quite briskly, thanks to Hammersmarck's storytelling gift. Intentionally setting his tale in 1984, he recreates the East Berlin of the Eighties with remarkable veracity, deliberately keeping the color texture confined to darker shades so that its bleakness would reflect the day to day life inside the Eastern Bloc. In this capacity, special kudos must be given to his production design team.The music by Gabriel Yared (THE ENGLISH PATIENT; THE TALENTED MR RIPLEY) is another asset. Hammersmarck was impressed with his score for THE TALENTED MR RIPLEY, especially in the scenes where the eponymous protagonist's duplicity is nearly exposed. Keeping in mind the parts where Georg Dreyman discreetly navigates the dangerous political currents ~as does Wiesler to some extent~ he surmised that Yared could heighten those moments of suspense. It was an inspired choice!The acting is magnificent, particularly with the three leads. Sebastian Koch and Martina Gedeck are irreproachable as Georg and Christa-Maria, but it's Ulrich Mühe who steals the show as Wiesler. Initially a feared bureaucrat, the Stasi man first unexpectedly finds himself discovering his humanity, and then must wrestle with his own conscience while reconciling his own past misdeeds. Wiesler is a multilayered individual, and Mühe, who grew up in East Germany, does an extraordinary job of bringing those layers out. Sadly, at the same time THE LIVES OF OTHERS was winning accolades all over the world ~including an Oscar for Foreign Language Film~ Mühe was dying of stomach cancer, leaving this masterwork as one of his last.Although THE LIVES OF OTHERS has a pessimistic atmosphere for much of the 137 minute running time, it does have its instances of optimism. One of this outstanding motion picture's many attributes is the extent of decency which human beings are capable of when given the opportunity. THE LIVES OF OTHERS is as close a life affirming movie as you'll ever see. 🔚",12 May 2023

",5,"The Wolf of Wall Street is an entertaining and amusing enough film. It has plenty of crude scenes which are designed to shock and amuse, which is fine though ultimately becomes rather predictable.Given that the film is loosely based on the real Jordan Belfort's memoirs it puzzles me that the director would have used Belfort's memoirs to create a film that basically sends the message that ""greed is good"" to the audience.This isn't a film that gives the audience any lessons to be learned as a result of the pursuit of short-term profits which are based on a machismo-style lying and swindling. This is simply a film that tells an amoral story all the way through. There is no central message, apart from the message that it's fun to swindle the general public through dodgy insider trading and exploiting legal loopholes to accrue massive amounts of wealth and status.While 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is an entertaining film for those who don't want to think about what they are watching. For those who are actually aware of the enduring effects of the 2008 banking crisis, it is ultimately depressing to see a film that has no moral message and falsely elevates sociopathic characters like Belfort into a kind of tragic hero who serves as a kind of twisted Nietzschean role-model to narcissistic people who only care about the pursuit of wealth and status.",30 December 2023

If you don't count, the jumpstreet movies, and the direction of Martin Scorsese feels more modern and feels more alive and with heart, Margot Robbie is another performance stealer because of one ,her good looks and two her acting in this movie was so refreshing, And I don't know that much about the Wall Street business, but from the looks of it, it looks very dangerous, and feels untrustworthy to the point where you have to really pay close attention to what you say and to who you're talking to.

This film is a rollercoaster ride of ambition, greed, and debauchery, anchored by Leonardo DiCaprio's electrifying performance as Jordan Belfort, the infamous stockbroker whose rise and fall epitomizes the corrupting influence of power and money.DiCaprio's portrayal of Belfort is nothing short of phenomenal. He fully embodies the character's charismatic, manic energy, and moral ambiguity, delivering a performance that is both captivating and disturbing. The way DiCaprio navigates through Belfort's highs and lows, from his intoxicating success to his inevitable downfall, is a testament to his range and skill as an actor.The supporting cast is equally impressive, particularly Jonah Hill as Donnie Azoff, Belfort's loyal yet equally flawed right-hand man. Hill's comedic timing and chemistry with DiCaprio add a dynamic layer to the film, providing both humor and depth to the narrative. Margot Robbie, as Naomi, is a revelation, bringing strength and complexity to a role that could easily have been overshadowed in a less capable actor's hands.Scorsese's direction is masterful, showcasing his signature style of fast-paced editing, dynamic camera work, and a keen eye for detail. He crafts a world that is both alluring and repulsive, drawing the audience into the seductive glamour of Belfort's lifestyle while never shying away from the darker, more destructive aspects of his actions.The script, written by Terence Winter, is sharp, witty, and engaging. It manages to weave humor and satire into a narrative that also speaks to larger issues of corporate greed and moral bankruptcy. The dialogue is fast-paced and crackles with energy, capturing the frenetic world of Wall Street in the 90s.""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is also a technical marvel, with excellent cinematography, editing, and a soundtrack that perfectly complements the film's tone. The use of music, in particular, enhances the film's immersive experience, capturing the spirit of the era and the excesses of Belfort's world.While the film's explicit content and moral ambiguity might not be to everyone's taste, it's precisely these elements that make ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" a bold and honest portrayal of Belfort's life. It doesn't glorify his actions but instead presents them in all their outrageousness, leaving the judgment to the audience.In summary, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is an exhilarating, unapologetic depiction of greed and excess.

The actor's chemistry with Jonah Hill, who plays Belfort's eccentric business partner Donnie Azoff, is electric, providing some of the film's most memorable and outrageous moments.Scorsese's direction is masterful, capturing the excesses of the 1980s and 1990s with a frenetic pace and bold visual style. The film's editing, coupled with Thelma Schoonmaker's expertise, creates a relentless and immersive experience that mirrors the chaos of Belfort's life. The use of voiceover narration and breaking the fourth wall adds a unique layer of storytelling that keeps the audience engaged from start to finish.While ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is undeniably entertaining, it doesn't shy away from the moral ambiguity of its characters. The film serves as a scathing critique of the unchecked greed and moral decay within the financial world. It forces the audience to confront the consequences of unchecked ambition and the toll it takes on individuals and society.The supporting cast, including Margot Robbie, Kyle Chandler, and Matthew McConaughey, all deliver standout performances that contribute to the film's overall brilliance. Robbie, in particular, brings depth to her character, providing a strong counterpoint to the male-dominated world of high finance.The film's three-hour runtime may seem daunting, but every minute is packed with energy, humor, and biting social commentary. It's a wild and unapologetic ride that leaves a lasting impression, prompting reflection on the excesses of the era and the broader issues of morality and accountability.In conclusion, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a cinematic spectacle that leaves an indelible mark. Scorsese's direction, coupled with DiCaprio's powerhouse performance, makes it a must-watch for anyone seeking a rollercoaster of emotions, from laughter to discomfort, in a brilliantly crafted narrative. Strap in and brace yourself for a journey into the dark heart of Wall Street.",18 December 2023

Belfort was a pretty interesting character, because he's supposed to come off as a super bad person, but I think that any good movie needs those kinds of people. Even after all he did, he didn't even suffer that much in the end. The movie was super long, and I honestly think it could've accomplished the same story in a much shorter time frame.

This cinematic adaptation ventures down a path riddled with errors and unnecessary changes that blur the intrinsic magic of the original narrative.One of the major missteps lies in the portrayal of the Battle of Hogwarts. Instead of capturing the intensity and desperation described in the book, the film opts for a visually stunning yet empty presentation. Much of the military strategy, brave sacrifices, and emotional moments that defined that epic confrontation are omitted, leaving fans with a diluted and superficial version.The handling of the revelation about the Elder Wand is another blow of hopelessness for fans of the series. Rather than staying true to the book, the movie presents a confusing and simplified sequence that leaves viewers wondering what exactly happened. This narrative choice strips one of the key moments of the saga of its emotional impact and symbolic depth.Furthermore, the lack of character development is evident, especially in the case of Ginny Weasley. Her crucial role in the book is reduced to brief moments, robbing followers of seeing the true strength and determination of this character. This omission negatively affects the emotional context of the story and impoverishes the richness of the relationship between Harry and Ginny.In summary, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2"" presents itself as a visually impressive yet narratively unfortunate conclusion.

The book wasn't split up in two parts, and thus the movie shouldn't neither. Having watched the whole series back-to-back, together with the whole family, I can only state the separation of the final big chapter only adds more power and intensity to the franchise.If you consider the ""Harry Potter"" franchise as an extended ""coming-of-age"" story, like I always have, part one of ""The Deathly Hallows"" is basically the conclusion of the growing up cycle, whereas part two is pure dark-magic business. In this marvelous swan song, there hardly isn't time anymore for puppy love or growing pains, and everything focuses on the salvation of Hogwarts and the ultimate confrontation with Lord Voldemort and his ever-growing villainous army. The story builds up steadily, with the quest for the last Horcruxes (containing pieces of Voldemort's soul), but then one of the most epic battles in cinematic (and literature) history breaks loose.Prepare for genuinely unexpected and convoluted plot twists. In fact, there are so many unforeseeable surprises and revelations in this film that I strongly recommend watching it at least twice; - or once per year like my wife and daughter. Prepare for exhilarating but also heart-breaking visual spectacle, as Hogwarts - the school we have all grown to love over the previous seven installments - narrowly gets destroyed. Prepare to acquaint with new characters & reacquaint with almost forgotten ones! Suddenly, Dumbledore has an entire family, and there's finally an extended and worthy role for the magnificent Warwick Davis. Prepare for a darker atmosphere and more mature horror than ever before. Oh yes, there will be blood. There will be deaths. Admittedly the ending is a bit too sentimental for my taste, but it's loyal to the book, and at least it's not as overlong and sappy as the ending of the (massively overrated) ""Return of the King"" from LotR.Most of all, prepare for - in my humble opinion, that is - the best Harry Potter movie since the almighty ""Prisoner of Azkaban"".

Jaime and I wanted to revisit this one after having seen the prequel of Wonka. We wanted to see how well it could fit in story-wise.Then for this adaptation of the source material, we are following Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum). He is a poor boy who lives with his mother, Mrs. Bucket (Diana Sowle), her parents who include Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson), as well as her deceased husband's parents. All the grandparents are confined to one bed. Mrs. Bucket works in a laundry where Charlie has picked up a job delivering newspapers.In the area, there is the infamous Wonka Chocolate Factory. It has been sealed up for some time. All that comes out would be the products that are made there. Things change though when Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) hosts a contest, offering a lifetime supply of chocolate to the winners. There are five golden tickets hidden in the wrapper of chocolate bars. This brings Augustus Gloop (Michael Bollner), Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole), Violet Beauregarde (Denise Nickerson) and Mike Teevee (Paris Themmen) to the factory along with one guardian. Charlie is also the improbable last guest with his grandfather.It is inside that they all get a taste of the madness of Wonka and his crew that help him produce his candy. They are a strange race known as Oompa Loompas. The kids are told not to do it and when they go against what Wonka said, we see what the repercussions are. Wonka isn't fully letting on what his plan is and it will take a true act of kindness to succeed.What I'm going to say to lead off here is that this is a fun movie. Wilder is perfectly cast in this eccentric role of Wonka. He adds snark and sarcasm to the role that make me laugh. It is funny that Jaime looked at me multiple times while watching this to say that is something I'd say. Something interesting is that Wonka is supposed to be a jovial person. I get part of that here, but he also seems tired and just over the world as well. It makes sense in the end as well.This version of the story is a fantastical story and place that still feels grounded in the real world. Things seen inside of this factory don't make sense to the visitors, but to Wonka, it is normal. I do love that as it is a tough line to walk. It does a great job at capturing the heart of Roald Dahl's novel and bringing it to life. I'll be honest though, I had this read to me when I was in fourth grade, but I don't remember a lot of the book for obvious reasons. It is impressive that this is done at a time of practical effects as well. That adds charm to it.What also makes this work is the acting. I've said how good Wilder is. It is interesting that with the new one out, Timothée Chalamet feels like the younger version to me. Albertson is good as Grandpa Joe, a character that is problematic while still being beloved. I thought that Ostrum was good as Charlie. He has the best heart and intentions of the golden ticket winners. Cole, Nickerson, Themmen and Bollner are good as the other kids who have character flaws that explain why they fall victim to different things in the factory. Roy Kinnear, Leonard Stone, Nora Denney and Ursula Reit are all good as well as the parents who should shoulder blame. All the Oompa Loompas are great and the rest of the cast push our characters to where they end up.I'll then end this out saying that this is a classic. It is a funny movie. There are good messages here that have a different feeling now that I'm a parent. The acting is good. This is a well made movie. Extra credit there to make this fantastic place come to life in what feels like a real world. This captures that the best. Effects are good as are the different songs that we hear. That is something else, this is a well made musical as well. I highly recommend this if you haven't seen it in awhile as this is just great.My Rating: 9 out of 10.",1 January 2024

",10,"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a timeless classic, known amongst generations for it's charm, family entertainment, and spectacular performance of Willy Wonka, provided by the late, great Gene Wilder. Directed by Mel Stuart, and produced by David L. Wolper, this film is based upon the 1964 children's classic ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" written by world renowned author, Roald Dahl.The story follows Charlie Bucket (played by Peter Ostrum), a boy who is down on his luck and who's family is impoverished. Still, he is as happy as any kid can be, and his family is really close, something that the audience loves to see. Particularly, he is close with his mother (Diana Mae Sowel), and his bed-ridden, yet sharp, grandfather, Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson). After a fateful announcement that Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder), a magician in the candy making world, was opening his factory to 5 lucky children who happened to find Golden Tickets, it would seem that Charlie's hopes were about to come true. The first four tickets are found, or given in one case, to some children who seem to be... crude or mean. After a false ticket finding, Charlie finds the fifth Golden Ticket and is whisked away to a world of splendor, one not known to man. On the first day of October, at 10 in the morning, Charlie Bucket, his grandfather, and the other ticket winners are led into the almost ethereal universe that is Willy Wonka's factory.Along the way, four of the five ticket winners meet their memorable, and very ironic, early tour ends and Charlie is left at the end, seemingly to win the entire contest... until Willy Wonka yells at him and his grandfather for ""breaking the rules"". This confuses and upsets Charlie and Grandpa Joe, with the latter threatening to get even with Wonka by selling the boy's Everlasting Gobstopper to an enemy confectioner, but Charlie does the right thing and give the treat back, prompting Wonka to say ""So shines a good deed in a weary world"". The candy man turns around one last time and says that Charlie has won, leading him and Grandpa Joe into the ""Great Glass Wonkavator"", which he uses to bust out of the roof of the factory in one last surprise, giving Charlie the entire factory as his grand prize... ""Don't forget what happened to the man who suddenly got everything he's always wanted... he lived happily every after.""So this film, released in 1971, has gone down in history as one of the greatest family films of all time, and it has earned that title graciously. Though some aspects of the film have not aged the best, including the centerpiece of the Chocolate Room, the river, the movie is still visually pleasing and eye candy to look at, no pun intended. The colors are bright and vivid, and it easily helps the viewer to believe in this fantastical world. The songs, as well, are memorable and fun to sing with. From the minds of Anthony Newly and Leslie Bricuse comes the wonderful and iconic soundtrack, with such numbers as ""The Candy Man"", ""I've Got a Golden Ticket"" and ""Pure Imagination"", to name a few, each song as timeless as the movie itself.Overall, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a fantastic watch for any family with its great music, funny dialogue, and engrossing visuals. The morals that can be derived are good ones for children to learn, as well. This film is a must watch for any family, and will forever go down in history as one of the greatest works of cinema of all time.",21 December 2023

",8,"I watched this before ""Wonka"" and it still holds up!What surprised me about this movie was how great it is even before they get into the factory! It's well setup with introducing the characters, (enough that we clearly who they all are) the hunt for the golden tickets is surprisingly exciting (and fairly realistic to what I would imagine it would be like if a company did something like it) and creating intrigue around the Willy wonka character. Charlie is setup well too as he leaves you sympathetic towards him with his situation with his family, so you root for him.When they do make it to the factory it is fun! It is magical while becoming just the right amount of disturbing and darkly comedic.(I do think the rotten kids survived by the way. Wonka says as much in one scene. I do enjoy the uncertainly of it though)
How could I not mention Wonka himself. Just his introduction might be one of the great character introductions that perfectly shows from the beginning you can not always predict what is going on with this guy. His sardonic witty personality adds much to it too! (That's where the late Gene Wilder was a perfect fit for the character).My few criticisms of the film are I don't really care for the floating to the fan scene with grandpa Joe and Charlie. I feel like if you're trying to establish that Charlie is the good obedient kid that scene does the opposite. To be fair Grandpa Joe was influencing him and maybe it was to show that Charlie isn't perfect (the problem ""Charlie and the chocolate factory"" has) If Charlie hadn't gotten down from the fan he would not have been any different than the other kids. And them getting down by burping seemed a bit juvenile in an otherwise smart movie. Second, while Charlie is well setup as a character from the beginning I do wish we learned more about why he desired the golden ticket so badly. (Especially when it's more clearer with the other kids, wanting the golden ticket for selfish reasons). Grandpa Joe says it's Charlie's dream but I feel we do not really see that much with Charlie. (Besides some scenes of disappointment when he doesn't get the ticket the first couple of times). And the last couple Oppa Loopa songs are a little forced (like we get the message you don't have to sing it to us!) The rest of their songs are catchy though and that goes for the rest of the soundtrack too! This is also a musical and the songs are very memorable! (I just watched it and I already have some of the songs in my head!) And there are some quoteable quotes by the end which is always a plus for me! Besides my few qualms with it this is overall a timeless classic and will be for years to come!",20 December 2023

A fine send-off to the Infinity Saga, with the caveat that you have to watch the previous 21 MCU movies to get the most out of it.Where Infinity War is a superbly-paced thrilling fantastic blockbuster full of surprises, Endgame is a predictable fan-service love-in, with the kind of key-character 'random' encounters that soap operas love to contrive. If you haven't watched all previous films a lot of the emotional character beats are gonna leave you cold. And I should know, as I watched this last year with only having seen IW beforehand. It left me unmoved. 5/10. Now, on the back of watching all MCU movies in order, it deserves the 8/10. The emotional beats got me this time!While Endgame is fine high-end entertainment, it doesn't quite thrill or excite like Infinity War did. The plot is so full of holes, and rewriting Thanos's motivations cheapen his character. The pacing is a little more uneven, even the action is a bit more generic. The soundtrack too. Captain Marvel's cameos were immersion-breaking, but thankfully not a game-breaking issue.If it sounds like I'm too down on the film, it's only because I'm comparing it to one of the greatest sci-fi/fantasy blockbusters of all time (Infinity War being a super-rare 10/10). Judging Endgame on its own merits, and as part of - and climax to - the epic Infinity Saga, it's definitely a good strong effort.

Directors Anthony and Joe Russo (also the directors of Avengers: Infinity War, as well as two of the Captain America films) and their team of writers have ensured, with machinelike precision, that each Avenger gets his or her proper allotment of sensitive moments, as well as heroic ones.

This includes that the fact the movie was based in the 1960s had an effect on the movie in a good way, it wouldn't have been the same if it was 1990s based because there would be characteristic changes to the movie that would add dullness. The movie had some crude humour which was not overrated, it gave the movie some entertainment to get the audience interesting into listening to jokes. I also love that I can recommend this movie to any audience as it would be entertaining for child and adult audience. I also found the kid actors did really good because they were not mature and acted like normal kids in the movie, it was like it wasn't staged. In most movies nowadays the younger actors (kids) act really mature and make the movie seem boring, give the movie a grey dullness.But all good things have to come to an end. I thought the movie overall personally had 3 big issues. The fact that it was made in 1993 makes it 25 years old. In the last 25 years heaps of filming technology, technical and symbolic codes and editing has been changed. This means the movie should be recreated but with kids that have all the strengths and fix the following weaknesses. I found part of the movie was clichéd, especially at the beginning because you know he is going to start to get more accepted. I also found that David Mickey Evans could have made there be fewer attempts to get the ball.Overall I give this movie 5/5, I would happily increase the rating the recreation of the movie is to what I said in the weaknesses.

The boys of the Sandlot are afraid of the dog, afraid of Mr. Mertle, afraid of girls.And they overcome it. By being forced to face their fears (and with some inspiration), they get the Babe Ruth ball, Smalls joins the ball team. They learn Mr. Mertle is very nice and a cool guy to know, the dog a kind creature who was likely just trying to play with them. And Squint marries that one girl.It's a pretty good coming of age story, and it's pretty funny. However, the writing I don't think is good or unique enough to make something interesting of the tropes it uses like the first person narration or the trope of every kid succceeding after the story. Those tropes make the film feel more genetic than it actually is, which is a shame. Having the dog be the antagonist instead of proving themselves against a official baseball team is a good subversion and makes the story quite interesting, even if at points it feels like it drags on too long.So in all I'd say the movie is above average, it's nearing on being great.

",10,"After Avengers Infinity War, we waited for the Avengers Endgame. We wondered how the story would go on, how our heroes would turn back, what would be the end of Thanos. Many theories related to this have been put forward. Avengers Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the probability of disappointment. But this is not the case for Endgame. Whatever you're expecting, you find much more in the film. This means that the biggest concern about the film has disappeared.On the other hand, another comparison comes up. Is Endgame more successful than Infinity War? We can comfortably say it Avengers Infinity War is just the beginning of the story. Endgame was the finale of the story. So we shouldn't think of these two films as two separate stories. There is only one story divided into two parts.Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.Of course, Avengers Endgame has some critical aspects. For example, is the three-hour period necessary in terms of the story? It can be discussed. The head of the story moves much slower than the rest. It also drags the heroes into an emotional predicament. Then the tempo is rising and the heavy scenes we are watching are getting more meaningful. The last 45 minutes of the movie is fully action packed. But the last 45 minutes goes so fast that you don't even realize it. Action and battle scenes are really successful. There is not even a slight distress about visual effects. There are also slight logic errors in the film, but in general the story is so successful that these details become meaningless and insignificant after a certain point.Lastly, Avengers Endgame doesn't have a movie end scene. Because after the film's final, there is no need for another scene. The Marvel legend Stan Lee appears with a small stage. But this is the last surprise scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Moreover, there is no clue about Marvel's future. This makes us wonder more about.",25 December 2023

The film retains the characteristic humour and chemistry between the characters that is a hallmark of Marvel productions.However, with a 4/10 rating comes some significant flaws. The story may seem overly complicated and lengthy, which may be lost on some viewers. Some of the character decisions can feel ill-considered and at times inconsistent with their previous development.Also, the film seems to gloss over some characters and aspects of the story, which can make it feel unfinished. Although it attempts to combine many elements into a coherent whole, some parts of the story can feel chaotic rather than coherent.The 4/10 rating also reflects some technical shortcomings. Although the visual effects are striking, they can look too kitsch. The music, which should have been emotionally powerful, sometimes gets lost in the noisy scenes and doesn't have the impact one would expect.Overall, ""Avengers: Endgame"" is a contradictory film that offers a spectacular visual experience, but with a 4/10 rating, it falls short of all expectations.

",7,"THE SANDLOT (B+) is a fantastic family film set around the summer of 1962 (complete with 60's soundtrack!) when fifth grader Scott Smalls moves to the San Fernando Valley and falls in with a bunch of kids who play baseball. As the new kid in town, he wants to make friends and thankfully the leader of the gang of kids who play ball, Benny Rodriguez, is a nice kid and includes Smalls in their clan (he makes their 9th player, a full team). The story of the summer takes on many forms and tones. It's part Stand By Me dramatic kid bonding by taking on a quest together (complete with insightful voice over!), part teen coming of age comedy (complete with chewing tobacco, ogling over girls at the pool, and facing down bullies), and part kid sports drama (it's shot through with a genuine love of baseball). The key plot point here is that the boys play baseball most days of the summer in an abandoned sandlot. Whenever someone hits a homerun into a particular fenced yard, the baseball is unrecoverable due to a large, loud, and vicious dog who rules the yard. The boys have even concocted horror origin stories for the dog (and the film wisely uses an obviously oversized suit/mannequin any time parts of the dog are visible - the thing is treated a bit like Spielberg treated the shark in Jaws. When another ball gets lost in the yard, Scott Smalls remembers his dad had a prized baseball in his room and decides to use it to keep the fun summer games going. Unfortunately, that ball gets knocked into the yard as well and Smalls reveals the ball was signed by some lady Baby Ruth. The rest of the squad goes nuts and reveals to Smalls who Babe Ruth is. There's a lot of comedy mined from the kids attempting to get the ball back only to be beaten back time and time against by the backyard beast. The final attempt sees the fastest kid in the group Benny (after a dream with Babe Ruth encourages him) hop the fence and put his speed to the test against the beast. I love that when Benny decides to face the fear and jump the face he doesn't see the comical beast we've seen so far, but a real dog. The bold feat leads to a foot race all through town as the dog chases Benny down and winds up back where they started, but an accident knocks the fence down and traps the dog. When the boys help the dog get out they make a new friend and the beast shows the boys his pile of balls. When the boys get the courage to talk with the owner of the dog (James Earl Jones) they realize he's not the monster they had made him out to be. It turns out the owner is blind and used to be a player in the Negro leagues but knew and played with the Babe. He takes mercy on the boys and trades them their chewed-up ball for a ball signed by all the 1927 Yankees. When I said the film was part Stand By Me, it's essentially a facsimile of Stand By Me but toned down, sanitized, and covered over with a veneer of wonder and optimism for a family audience. The narrator, the nerd kid, the knowledgeable older kid, the puking, the life obstacles tackled together, the joys and struggles of childhood...it's all here. While I appreciate the more grounded nature of Stand By Me and how it confronts the viewer with a more truthful version of growing up, I'm glad a version like THE SANDLOT can exist alongside it as well. Both films capture truths of that age in different ways. I think we need both visions, both sides, or we lose an important balance. I think viewed back to back they can make for a fascinating study in contrasts.",13 April 2023

I thought it was hilarious the last time I watched it, but then again, I was a kid. The real test is watching a kid-oriented movie as an adult and seeing if you'll laugh. I'm happy to say I enjoyed the whole thing. It's a relatively uncomplicated story, but still manages to have plenty of humor and thought-provoking lessons. It's about 10-year-old Scott Smalls (Tom Guiry). During the summer of 1962, he moves to a new neighborhood in California with his mom and stepfather. He's a nerdy kid who prefers to stay in the house doing engineering type projects. His mom wants him to get out and have adventures before school starts. A kid who's older than him (he looked to be in his early teens) invites him to play baseball. None of the other kids like him. He's terrible at catching the ball. He gets a black eye when his stepfather is teaching him in the backyard. The older kid basically takes him under his wing, and over time his catching skills improve. He also becomes less awkward. There's a ferocious dog on the other side of a fence, so that makes for substantial comedy. It's a funny and endearing movie. Despite having been filmed in 1993, it seems to be (and I say seems because I wasn't around at that time) a realistic portrayal of how kids interacted with one another back then. Coincidentally, I was born the year this movie came out. I watch a lot of vintage TV shows and movies, and this film gets an A+ for accuracy. There is a stomach churning scene - they start throwing up on a carnival ride. Their vomit splatters down on other people. It was really gross, and the burping sound effects didn't help. So I suggest not eating while you watch this.Some people might think this is a guys' movie. I'm a female and I loved it. It's a movie for both sexes. The only thing I can find wrong is how the filmmakers used adult material in a movie that was marketed towards children. There is some ambiguity as to whether or not it can be called family friendly, at least in my opinion anyway. It's actually quite surprising that it's rated PG, considering the dialogue is more on par with a PG-13 rating. There's a few uses of the s-word (which I didn't even remember, so that was new to me). One of the kids who's a catcher attempts to distract a batter from the opposing team by saying he can see his sister standing out in the field naked, and then I think he asked 'do you think she'll go out with me?' I thought that was out of place for a kids' film. The Sandlot is definitely a great movie for teenagers. And kids in middle school, which is 11 to 13. As long as you have consistent talks with your child about manners and boundaries, they should be able to watch a rated PG film that contains some vulgarity without imitating what they see on the screen. It's not an ideal movie for young children, but it's appropriate for 11 and older.",26 November 2022

Actually more specifically it's about growing up in America at that time with baseball, apple pie and fireworks on the fourth of July as constants.If you didn't grow up in either that time or that place then I think that the sense of nostalgia isn't so profound.

I remember really liking the first half or two-thirds of this the first time I watched it, but found it dragging near the end. I had a very different experience this time - it felt like there were very few points where it dragged, and the ending was more impactful than I remembered. I'm not sure why I didn't appreciate the final 20 to 30 minutes last time - I don't even have the excuse of me being much younger and less patient, because I believe it was in early 2020!It's about a kidnapping/ransom plot that goes wrong, given the perpetrator kidnaps the wrong kid. But then he goes through with his extortion plan anyway, trying to get a large sum of money off a wealthy businessman who's in the middle of making a risky move within the company he works for.It really is just so well-shot from beginning to end, with plenty of long shots that don't always draw attention to themselves, yet last a good deal of time and all looked as though they would have been tricky to set up and execute. It's a methodically made movie, and watching it a second time, things still remain suspenseful throughout. I also think the performances work wonders for making it all so engaging, with Toshiro Mifune and Tatsuya Nakadai leading the cast and both giving some of their best-ever performances.I think this is my favorite non-samurai movie from Kurosawa, and overall, I still prefer Seven Samurai and Ran by a hair. But this is exceptionally well-made and very engrossing, considering its long runtime and the way it is a bit of a slow burn (especially in the first act).

Once it gets going, though, it's one of the best crime thrillers I've seen in ages. It all centres around the kidnapping of a small boy for whom the anger-prone, shoe millionaire ""Gondo"" (a strong contribution from Toshirô Mifune) is supposed to pay a ransom of ¥30 million - a colossal sum. It turns out, though, that it's not his son who has been snatched - it's the child of his chauffeur. Why ought he to pay? Will he just get on with his impending company takeover or will he risk bankruptcy for the young ""Shinichi""? This is a film split into three sections. The first deals with the decision making process around will he/won't he/why should he. Next, the police must try to apprehend this individual. This process is meticulously carried out and Kurosawa has chosen to immerse us in some of that detail, rather than just cursorily skip through it. This makes the whole detection process a much more interesting part of the film; allowing some aspects of the characterisation of the police officers to develop and also introducing some dark humour to the proceedings. Finally, we reach the denouement with it's own rather curious and not entirely explicable agenda. There's an element of ""what would you do?"", there's a grim depiction of a seamier side of Japanese (heroin-fuelled) culture that we seldom get to see and there is a rather starkly effective dose of humanity presented here as the story juggles aspects of human nature, nurture and good old fashioned greed in quite an effective fashion.

",9,"The film is two hours long and consists of two main story lines divided at about the 50% mark that are related but contrast sharply in terms of setting and even genre.For the first part, a wealthy man is hit with extortion from a possible third party during a very tense business exchange where he is attempting to wrest a company from rivals. The extortion comes at such a point in his life that it will ruin everything he's worked for, and he and everyone around him grapple with existential questions such as how much the life is a poor boy is worth.This part is compelling as an analysis of ethics, not only for the protagonist who needs to decide whether the justifications he makes up are enough to counter the decision not to pay the random, but from other businessmen, his wife, and the police, who all have their own agendas and make reverberating ethical valuations as well.The second half is a police procedural action where the police meticulously search out the suspect throughout the societal bowels of Tokyo. Although the suspect is a professional, he seems to be very comfortable among the lowest rungs of society, carousing among the social rejects of Japanese society in foreigner nightclubs and drug dens.Here we have an effective and suspenseful action film that keeps the mental gears oiled as the Japanese police schematize the minute details of searching for high-profile criminal in one of the most populous metropolises of the world.And therein lies the significance of the title: high and low - the high and the low of society coming into destructive contact with each other.The protagonist is a man of means who ends up being a hero baron and sacrificing himself to save the poor. Although the movie tries to make him out as a man who came from humble means, it's really money and influence that save the day here, so it's something of a right-wing fairy tale on a grand scale, glorifying the rich and social hierarchy.The ending is patchy. Everything is revealed but there's not much satisfaction in the emotional last speech. Nevertheless it's a great film with good, tense drama, compelling characters, and a decent script for the time.Honourable Mentions: The villain in this film reminds of playful but emotionally unstable serial killer types. He's very much reminiscent of the protagonist of another Japanese, Vengeance is Mine (1979). US films usually depict these psychopathic types as emotionless, as happens in Se7en (1995), so it's an interesting contrast.",15 August 2023
rw9254948,ur23542824,tt0057565," Navigating Moral Terrain in a Postmodern Cinematic Landscape
",8,"Arguably not among the pinnacle of Akira Kurosawa's works, this movie evoked a sentiment within me, reminiscent of prevailing contemporary audience inclinations, notably amplified subsequent to the rise of postmodernism and its reverberations within cinema. Upon concluding the movie, a discernible yearning for an element of astonishment surfaced in my experience. This inclination, I apprehended, germinates from the contemporary cinematic milieu, characterized by a propensity for narratives to surprise, catering primarily to the consumable facet of filmmaking. Following a protracted intermission from Kurosawa's cinematic repertoire, I engaged with ""Tengoku to jigoku,"" culminating in a realization necessitating a regression to my practice of seeing foreign films, diverging from their American counterparts.Throughout the film, an internal rumination pervaded, propelling the conjecture that the malefactor was conceivably none other than Gondo himself, spurred by the impulse to ascertain a rationale or motivation underpinning the crime. This introspection led me to postulate that Gondo orchestrated this contrived incident as a vehicle for self-aggrandizement, enshrining himself as a paragon of virtue. However, a subsequent revelation dawned, exposing Kurosawa's detachment from such a narrative trajectory. The film, in its essence, revolved inexorably around matters of ethical rectitude and the ramifications of human conduct within the precincts of moral precepts.My reservation towards embracing the film more ardently pertains, however, to its deficiency in delineating Takeuchi's impetus for his criminal act. Even though comprehensible that Kurosawa concluded the narrative with dilemmas evocative of Dostoyevsky's literary constructs, replete with characters grappling with moral quandaries, the film falters in delivering a comprehensive insight into the perpetrator's vantage and portrayal. Consequently, relegating Takeuchi to a mere narrative expedient, a vehicle facilitating the conveyance of the overarching thematic message. An inclination towards a more multifaceted and nuanced rendering appears exigent, transcending the constraints of a mere caricature.Addressing the film's socioeconomic stratum allusions and Kurosawa's potential ideological nuances, discernment remains elusive. The depiction oscillates between a benevolent magnate guided by altruistic intentions, forsaking personal ambition, and a character reminiscent of Dostoyevsky's Smerdyakov, or characters sourced from political texts, denoting an estrangement from communal struggles culminating in entanglement with transgressive acts. Yet, whether this conclusion proffers insights into the predicaments of the lower classes remains equivocal, shrouded in Kurosawa's ambiguity, a neutrality or indecision evinced in delineating a definitive standpoint.Regrettably, this ambivalence neither augments the narrative tension nor substantiates itself as a manifestation of authorial stance. Rather, it assumes the semblance of a deliberate evasion, contravening an overt manifestation of perspective. The quasi-zombic presence of the underprivileged substantiates a portrayal reflective of the human condition during that time in Japan. Nonetheless, the denouement furnishes an affluent bourgeois in the throes of a moral quandary oscillating between his wealth and the fate of his chauffeur's child.In spite of these deliberations, the film, as aforementioned, imparts a gentle admonition concerning genuine human interactions embroiled in moral intricacies, diverging from the ludic undertones emblematic of postmodern narratives typified by productions such as ""Usual Suspects."" Through this characteristic, the film engenders a contemplative stance within its viewers, instigating an introspective contemplation encompassing both the realms of artistic representation and possible life quandaries. Therefore, reserving intervals to engage with Kurosawa's work becomes imperative, facilitating a respite from the trappings of postmodern irony and cynicism, thus cultivating a reflective space.",12 August 2023

Unfortunately, just minutes after telling them this, the phone rings and he is told that his young son has been kidnapped and that he must pay a hefty ransom in order to have him returned. Needless to say, this puts him in a terrible bind as it means that his business deal will have to be put on hold and that he would now be at the mercy of his angry colleagues. To his surprise, however, just moments later, his son walks into the house and he immediately realizes that the kidnapper made a mistake and took his chauffeur's son instead.

This film stands as a testament to the brilliance of the genre, delivering an intense and thrilling experience that will leave you on the edge of your seat.The headline ""A Must-Watch Classic!"" perfectly encapsulates the impact and significance of Alien in the cinematic landscape. This movie is a pioneer in the science fiction genre, setting a benchmark for the countless films that followed. Its influence can still be felt in today's science fiction offerings.The film's strength lies in its ability to create an atmosphere of unrelenting tension. From the moment the crew of the Nostromo sets foot on the eerie planet, the sense of impending doom is palpable. Ridley Scott masterfully builds suspense, using every dark corner, creaking sound, and haunting score to keep the audience gripped throughout.One of the most iconic aspects of Alien is undoubtedly the creature design. H. R. Giger's nightmarish creation, the xenomorph, remains one of the most terrifying and visually striking creatures ever put on screen. Its sleek, biomechanical appearance combined with its relentless pursuit of the crew members creates an unforgettable antagonist that has become a staple in pop culture.The cast of Alien is also worth praising, with Sigourney Weaver delivering a career-defining performance as the resourceful and determined Ellen Ripley. Weaver's portrayal of Ripley is a trailblazing representation of a strong female lead in a genre that was often dominated by men. The supporting cast, including Tom Skerritt, John Hurt, and Ian Holm, all contribute to the film's authenticity and emotional depth.Furthermore, the film's practical effects and set designs are nothing short of exceptional. The claustrophobic interiors of the Nostromo and the eerie alien spaceship feel lived-in and believable, immersing the audience in this dystopian future. This attention to detail enhances the overall experience, making every moment feel genuine and impactful.While some may argue that the film's pacing is slow at times, it is precisely this deliberate pacing that allows the tension to simmer and build to a crescendo. Alien is not just about the scares; it is a thought-provoking exploration of humanity's vulnerability in the face of the unknown, the horrors that lurk in the darkness, and the strength of the human spirit when faced with unimaginable danger.In addition to its masterful storytelling and technical achievements, Alien also delves into deeper themes and subtext. It explores the concept of corporate greed and the exploitation of workers, serving as a critique of capitalism and the devaluation of human life in the pursuit of profit. These underlying themes elevate the film beyond a mere creature feature, making it a truly thought-provoking and intellectually stimulating experience.The cinematography in Alien is breathtaking, with Ridley Scott utilizing lighting and shadow to create a sense of unease and mystery. The use of practical effects, such as the chestburster scene, remains groundbreaking and shocking even by today's standards. The combination of stunning visuals, a haunting score, and exceptional editing all come together to create an immersive and unforgettable cinematic experience.It is worth noting that Alien may not be suitable for all viewers due to its intense and graphic nature. The film does not shy away from gore and body horror, which may be unsettling for some. However, for those who can appreciate the artistry and craftsmanship behind the film, Alien is an absolute must-watch.In conclusion, Alien is a true masterpiece that has stood the test of time. Its groundbreaking creature design, intense atmosphere, and thought-provoking themes make it a landmark film in the science fiction genre. With its unforgettable performances, stunning visuals, and relentless tension, Alien remains a must-watch classic for any cinephile or sci-fi enthusiast. Strap yourself in and prepare for a thrilling journey into the depths of space and the darkest corners of the human psyche.",1 January 2024

It's been a minute or ten years since I last watched the movie that has so far spawned five sequels or prequels (with more on the way) and in that time I somehow forget exactly how good it is, even though some of the jaw-dropping scenes are less potent than they might otherwise have been, only because I kind-of know what's going to happen.That said, I can only imagine how terrifying it must have been for those folks watching it at the cinemas on the big screen in 1979 with no inkling of what was to come, each scene more tense and unnerving than the one before. As the crew of the Nostromo land on an unknown planet and end up bringing a merciless alien creature aboard.The ship seems more and more claustrophobic with each scene of the slow-burn horror/sci-fi/action thriller, as the alien takes out one crewmember after another until only Sigourney Weaver's (now-iconic) Ellen Ripley remains.What a ride.",20 December 2023

",10,"""The Godfather"" is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of time and genre, cementing its place as an iconic pillar of storytelling in cinema history. Francis Ford Coppola's magnum opus weaves a gripping narrative that delves into the heart of power, loyalty, and the complexities of the human condition.Set in the dark underbelly of organized crime in post-World War II America, the film unfolds the saga of the Corleone family with an unparalleled blend of intensity and elegance. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone is nothing short of mesmerizing, capturing the essence of a man torn between his duty to family and the moral implications of his actions. Brando's gravitas brings an enigmatic depth to the character, making the audience empathize with a figure often seen as ruthless.Al Pacino's transformation from a reluctant outsider to a formidable force as Michael Corleone is a journey marked by emotional turmoil and a chilling metamorphosis. His portrayal is nuanced, showcasing the internal conflict as he navigates the morally murky waters of the mafia world. The evolution of Michael Corleone remains one of cinema's most captivating character arcs, drawing viewers into his tumultuous psyche.Beyond its stellar performances, ""The Godfather"" is a visual feast, with each frame meticulously crafted to evoke the era's ambiance. The cinematography, coupled with the haunting score by Nino Rota, creates an immersive experience that lingers long after the credits roll. Coppola's deft direction intertwines various themes-family, betrayal, honor, and power-into a tapestry that resonates universally.The film's legacy extends beyond its critical acclaim; it has become a cultural touchstone, quoted, referenced, and revered across generations. Its influence on filmmaking techniques, storytelling, and character development is undeniable, setting a standard that few movies have matched.In essence, ""The Godfather"" is not just a crime drama; it's a Shakespearean tragedy set against the backdrop of the American Dream. Its enduring impact lies in its ability to captivate, provoke introspection, and compel audiences to grapple with the complexities of morality and the allure of power. For cinephiles and casual viewers alike, experiencing ""The Godfather"" is not just watching a film-it's immersing oneself in a timeless work of art.",1 January 2024

I kept brushing it off in watching it even though I am a Anthony Hopkins fan. With nothing to do or watch with over 700 title's just didn't want to sit through something I watched too many times and decided to give it a try. Glad I did because it was one of the better movies I've sat through in a while. Now to me Anthony Hopkins is a actor's actor and with 3 Oscar's to prove his worth. Funny because I decided to watch it for another actor in it. All I said was it better be good and it was beyond good.A little historical piece about Burt Munro who earned a place in motorcycle sports history and to date holds a record that has yet to be broke. The characters he meets on his way to Utah's Salt Flats are interesting. His endless one liners are very amusing and some which made me giggle a few times. His persistence and not taking no for a answer was all the more grand.Why I never watched this sooner will never be known but glad I did.

It's a very sweet subplot in the movie, with Chris (as in Christopher) Williams quite touching. This has all the obstacles that an out-of-towner (or in this case out of country) has while on a holiday, and when he gets to near where he has to go gets welcomed aide from a kindly old native and a lonely older woman played by Diane Ladd.

The next major battle sequence at the bridge was quite amazing too but the first opening scene was quite overwhelming.The story in between the battles is still interesting. The major theme around this movie concerns the morality of forming a search party for one man. To save private Ryan, many lives have been sacrificed. Lives lost vs lives saved is a key theme and just like the members of the search party, the audience can't help but question the morality of it all. It's a flawed mission from the start but also is justified by the unimaginable potential grief of losing all four sons to war. Other aspects of the story of how Captain Miller is a hardened but still anxious English teacher turned into leader on the war field. The story of Upham and his idea of morality during wartime is also something to ponder about. This movie is great because it doesn't depict these guys as heroes and most of them die anyways. They are just regular people caught in fires of war.Watching fine and well-crafted movies like this should all bring anti-war sentiments. There is nothing glorious about war. Although the movie starts and ends with the American flag, it is seen as a nod of respect for those who have perished in war rather than calling for more people on the battlefield. If the latter was the purpose, the Omaha beach scene would have been more glamorized. Chilling movie.",31 December 2023

",7,"Saving Private Ryan has become something of a landmark film, inspiring many other subsequent films to follow its lead and portraying an unsentimental, absolutely brutal world war 2. I have no doubt this is a good film, but I must find some faults with it. The film is overlong and overly exhausting. One of this films strengths is that its action sequences are so tightly choreographed and well edited that it draws you in easily and you can become easily absorbed by it. The film is hence not exhausting due to technical deficiencies- it becomes slightly too long because its plot does not move much. Neither do their characters grow much. I find Tom Hanks later effort(which he helped produce), Band Of Brothers, to be much better, and perhaps the best media in the genre. Saving Private Ryan lacked the camaraderie, the kinship, and it also lacked the war drama or the insightful observations about war seen in band of brothers. While there is some profound insights in dialogue between characters in the film, it never felt as heartfelt or touching as that in the miniseries. To me, Saving Private Ryan felt too straightforward and empty in its storytelling- there are little to no complications involved in this adventure. Of course, I cannot doubt that this is a landmark film, a film which almost all subsequent war productions earn a debt to. It is bloody, visceral, and devastating in how it portrays the horrors of war. It's action is also so competently done and so enthralling that it has the ability to absorb one in. But it is still a film with a plot that does not earn its 3 hour runtime. It perhaps has too much of a documentary quality to it which dissuaded me from rating it any higher.",26 December 2023

",10,"In this film, there was a war between the United States and the Germans; during the war, the unit was ordered to go and search for a soldier named Private Ryan (Matt Damon) because all his brothers were killed during the war. The unit was led by Captain Miller (Tom Hanks), Sergeant Mike Horvath (Tom Sizemore), Private Reiben (Edward Burns), and Private Jackson (Barry Pepper).As the film started on the beach it was very realistic and exciting as the soldiers tried to come ashore and clear the beach. Captain Miller and his unit was one of a group of soldiers was a school teacher he didn't know much about the war but he was deterninde to accomplished his directives that was givien to him by the superpoirs.First, I must say this film was terrific, and the editing that took place to make this film must have been very difficult. To have this film be lifelike was tremendous work, with everything occurring during any war. The emotions of this war were great. Also, when one of the men who was in the war was going to the cemetery where his fellow soldiers were buried, it was emotional for him. We could see that on his face as he approached the graves sites of the soldiers who were killed during the war. The scenes change from one to another, like you were in the film as it was being shot.The film will go from one scene or image to another with realistic images that transfer smoothly to include the person with their guts out to someone who had their arm blown off. The fight on the beach was the scene I believed was the most challenging to edit, and it had a smooth transition from scene to scene.The sound effects in this film were very loud and realistic from the start to the end. This was about finding another soldier and bringing him home during a war. During any war, there are bombs, guns, and many other explosives going all through the film, far and near.

I congratulate director Spielberg for his direction. I did not see any scene in the movie that could be criticized, that I could say was wrong here, or was badly done there. The movie was very fluent and enjoyable. When you watch people dying in a war movie (even if it's a movie), your heart breaks. In my opinion, war is one of the worst events in the world. While watching the struggle of these soldiers, whose arms and legs were torn to pieces and thrown around, under the rain of bullets, I thought for a moment that these situations were actually happening, even if I was not a soldier of my own country. How bad and painful the war was. I think the message given in the movie was very meaningful. Is it right to risk the lives of eight soldiers for the sake of one?

I appreciate every intricate piece of detail and latent content hidden and showcased in this film. From the ticking on Miller's planet to Brand and Copper's conversation about love, and how it traces back to Cooper and Grandpa's conversation on Earth. The film is not only about the wonders of science, the general relativity of space time or the existence of 5 dimensional beings or higher life forms referred to as 'they' but also about love, dreams, passion, gratification, achieving greatness, emotions and human connection at its very core. Like Brand mentions Love is the only thing we can perceive that transcends space time, a mysterious source of energy, a phenomenon we cannot understand but only feel, something that drives us to surpass our limits, the film depicts that incredibly well. Cooper leaves for space out of passion not purely for humanity's sake, Murph comes back to search for the truth only out of her love for her father, Brand travels to Edmund's planet purely out of love. The space is the canvas and love is the paint, and Nolan and his crew has painted a marvelous piece of artwork.

The fact that a mouse gets so much attention right from the start makes it feel like it's a fairy tale for children, when in reality it's not. In reality, the actions and words of people like Percy were considered quite normal in such places. This unintentionally makes adults who don't have much ""poetic kindness"" find it quite funny in a way.What made me a little unsatisfied was the character John Coffey when he was about to be put in the electric chair.

Writing a despicable character like that is already a difficult job; bringing it to life has to be a very difficult task to pull off, but Doug Hutchison passes with flying colors. While Michael Clarke Duncan was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for 8 different awards - winning 3 of them - Doug Hutchison received only one nomination, which he didn't end up winning.

In this movie, the same tactic as in The Shawshank Redemption was used, and John Coffey's character is innocent, just like Andy, and someone else committed the murder and blamed it on him. However, the character of John Coffey is black, large and has an incredibly emotional personality, contrary to his size. Coffey, who looks like a monster on the outside, is actually a defenseless person inside. Tom Hanks once again shows a great performance and forms a small friendship with Coffey and learns how good he is and that he has fantastic powers. However, Coffey is a death row prisoner and must be executed when the time comes... The execution scene of the movie is one of the most emotional moments in movie history.

Al Pacino burns brightly as Michael Corleone, grappling with the corrosive weight of leadership, while a young Robert De Niro smolders in the flashbacks, portraying a young Vito Corleone's rise to power.

Then in the storyline about Michael himself, the author found a lot of uncertainty regarding the things that happened to each character. For example, Fredo turns out to be the mastermind behind the difficulties in Michael's business.

It's literally the Jack Nicholson show for 2h 26m, and we're all just lucky to be witnessing it. Also, Stanley Kubrick's direction is unbelievably extraordinary. However it's such a pity to hear about his subhuman treatment of Shelley Duvall during filming. It doesn't dock my rating, but it is rather disappointing.Back to positives though, I was thoroughly impressed by Danny Lloyd's performance as Danny Torrance (the child), especially considering he didnt even know he was acting in a horror movie (as the crew had led him to believe they were shooting a drama film instead)! As for Shelley Duvall, I would say that her character wasn't written all that amazingly for this screenplay (which is actually part of the reason why Stephen King doesn't like this picture), but with saying that, I do think she managed to do the best she could, considering both this and the harsh treatment she suffered on set.Finally, despite the fact that this truly is the best horror flick I've watched, I found the ending quite bemusing, so much so that I honestly had to watch an 'Ending Explained' video just to get a grasp on it. Also, I found the climax just before it a little underwhelming, but in saying that, it did make sense to me once I'd understood the meaning behind the final shot. I guess what I'm trying to say is that Kubrick's execution of the closing 5 or 10 minutes was fairly flawed in my opinion.Overall, I was left speechless by this picture.

Stuart then tells Jack how isolated everything is and how it can get lonely and could affect his mental state. He also talks about a man killing his wife and daughters and then killing himself, which shows foreshadowing. I also love how I can slowly see Jack's mental state falling apart throughout the film. It builds Jack's character, and we can slowly see Jack losing his mental state. The way they portray the change in character is truly remarkable since it enhances how we see the character change over time from someone good to someone who has lost his mind and wants to kill his family, as Stuart said in the beginning.The film also shows the great symbolization of room 237. The room is mysterious, and that is where the killing of the family happened. Every time we see a scene in room 237, we get eerie background music in the film, which makes it more mysterious. It also shows isolation, hidden secrets, and temptation.One thing Kubrick could have done better is showing more horror and making it more horrifying.

He does this to give us a deeper connection with the characters. We see how the characters develop into the foreshadowed colors they are meant to represent. I can say that he can do more with the colors to make sure there are more things they can represent. Stanley Kubrick could have made a better intro to give the audience a little background, but that provides the story with a hook because we do not see the characters' past.

The cinematography, characterized by tight close-ups and skillful camera work, intensifies the emotional impact of these exchanges, making the audience feel like a silent observer in the jury room.Henry Fonda's portrayal of Juror #8, the lone juror advocating for reasonable doubt, is nothing short of brilliant. His calm demeanor and unwavering commitment to justice create a compelling contrast to the volatility of the other jurors. The gradual unraveling of each juror's character adds layers to the narrative, revealing the complexities of human behavior and the flaws within the justice system.Reginald Rose's screenplay, adapted from his own teleplay, is a masterpiece of dialogue and character exploration. The script delves into themes of prejudice, empathy, and the responsibility that comes with the power to decide another person's fate. The film's exploration of the legal system's potential for error remains relevant, sparking reflection on the importance of a fair and impartial judicial process.""12 Angry Men"" is not just a courtroom drama; it's a profound exploration of human psychology and societal norms. Its enduring appeal lies in its ability to transcend its era, offering timeless insights into the human condition. Sidney Lumet's direction, coupled with the exceptional performances of the cast, ensures that ""12 Angry Men"" remains a cinematic gem that continues to captivate audiences decades after its release.",31 December 2023

",9,"""Pulp Fiction"" is a cinematic whirlwind, a genre-defying masterpiece that subverts storytelling conventions, enthralling audiences with its bold narrative structure, razor-sharp dialogue, and kaleidoscope of eccentric characters. Directed by Quentin Tarantino, this film is a postmodern collage, blending crime, dark humor, and philosophical musings into an electrifying tapestry of interconnected stories.Tarantino's non-linear storytelling propels viewers through a series of vignettes that intersect and intertwine, crafting a narrative mosaic that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats. From hitmen Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) navigating philosophical debates in between violent encounters to the captivating dance of Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) and Vincent, each story thread is woven with meticulous detail and Tarantino's trademark wit.The film's dialogue crackles with intensity and pop culture references, elevating mundane conversations to moments of riveting tension or dark comedy. Tarantino's ability to infuse seemingly trivial discussions with profound depth and humor is a testament to his mastery of language and storytelling.What sets ""Pulp Fiction"" apart is its ensemble cast, each actor breathing life into their eccentric characters with unparalleled charisma. Travolta's revival as a leading man, Jackson's commanding presence, Thurman's enigmatic allure, and standout performances from a stellar supporting cast create an ensemble dynamic that keeps the film's momentum pulsating.The film's eclectic soundtrack, ranging from surf rock to soul, serves as an auditory backdrop that enhances the film's unique rhythm and atmosphere. Tarantino's use of music is not just complementary but integral to the film's identity, each song adding depth and texture to the scenes they accompany.At its core, ""Pulp Fiction"" is more than a crime film; it's a bold exploration of morality, chance, and the human condition. It revels in the chaos of existence, embracing the absurdity and unpredictability of life while inviting audiences to revel in its intoxicating blend of violence and humor.Decades after its release, ""Pulp Fiction"" remains a cultural touchstone, influencing filmmakers and captivating audiences with its audacious storytelling and indelible characters.

",8,"In a remote research station in Antarctica in 1982, the members of its team unexpectedly encounter the inhabitants of a neighboring Norwegian research station, who are trying to kill a dog that has escaped from their base. After killing the crazed Norwegians, the shaken research crew flies out to their base only to find all of them are either dead or missing. All they find are the remains of an unknown creature that the Norwegians had attempted to burn. It soon becomes clear to them all that what they have found is an alien life form. However, before long it becomes terrifyingly apparent that the creature can take over and copy other life forms, and that it spreads from one person to another like a virus. Before long paranoia takes hold of the team, whose trust in one another swiftly deteriorates, and terror descends upon them.An adaptation of John W. Campbell Jr., novella Who Goes There? The Thing had been originally loosely adapted into the 1951 science fiction-horror film The Thing from Another World. Several directors would be considered before cult movie director John Carpenter who had gained critical acclaim for his low-budget 1978 horror movie Halloween. Starring Kurt Russell who had only just previously worked with Carpenter on the science fiction action film Escape From New York, the movie features what was at the time a relatively unknown cast of actors. It, like Halloween, has a basic premise, which relies heavily on an ever-pervasive sense of dread, and a sense of cloying paranoia. It probably comes as no coincidence that the movie was released just a few short years after Ridley Scott's 1979 Science-Fiction Horror classic Alien. Indeed, it may be said that Carpenter may have taken some inspirational cues from Scott's masterpiece. Both have remote secluded settings which add a degree of claustrophobic tension into the mix. Quentin Tarantino himself has cited The Thing as having inspired his debut masterpiece Reservoir Dogs, with its themes of paranoia and the use of a small backdrop.Similar to 1956's Invasion of the Body Snatchers directed by Don Siegel, the movie relies on a growing sense of inevitability and dread, as each of the movie's 12 protagonists succumb to the paranoia that begins to swallow them. Its intense, somber atmosphere is echoed by Ennio Morricones' intense and eerie synth score. As with Halloween, Carpenter knows how to pull his audience's strings so before long they're looking over their shoulder, or looking around every corner long after the movie has ended. He makes excellent use of the minimalistic aspect of the movie's setting, with its closed-in environment adding to the ever-increasing anxiety of his characters. It's to the movie's testament that its amazing, eye-popping practical effects from Rob Bottin still hold up to this very day. When the Thing reveals itself under its human guise, the scenes of it contorting and twisting or detaching itself from the rest of its physiognomy are a true work of art. Carpenter also allows for subtle touches of subtle, dark humor while never undermining the movie's grueling intensity.In the role of R. J. MacReady, Russell is in typically dry and sardonic territory and brings just the right touch of wry bravado to proceedings. Essentially becoming the alpha male of a group of men, who have begun to turn in on themselves. He's given fine support from a cast that includes Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Keith David, and Donald Moffat.Both a commercial and critical flop on its release, and it perhaps wasn't helped that it had to contend with a certain Extra-Terrestrial, it has eventually been evaluated and given more of the kudos it deserves. The Thing is something of a seminal piece of film-making and a solid lesson in evoking atmosphere and a palpable sense of paranoia and dread. It along with Aliens stands as one of the cult iconic Science-Fiction Horror movies of the 80's.",4 January 2024

",8,"A feel like there's an effect where when an underrated film faces harsh criticism and condemnation, its fans positive opinions become that much stronger and vocal in order to unbury their hidden gem from its undeserved reputation. Was The Thing oversold to me; No, I think the merits on which my dad recommended it to me (the monsters, the flamethrowers, and a great chess game) were on point. It's more in later years that I have found the average internet opinion of the movie to be way too reverent in ways I feel are kind of misleading. Which is why it was really nice to get the chance to catch it on the big screen to really cement my opinions on whether or not I was missing something the fart sniffers were catching on to.I joke, of course, this film's reverence is relatively well earned, and I cannot blame or deny an enthusiastic fan their enthusiasm. It is quite possibly still the best special effects movie ever made, and if not, it is the most well realized and unique monster in movie fx history (though I would also need to put the 88 Blob in the running too.) That's quite an achievement considering how much time has passed, and may be a matter of opinion depending on how easily cgi tricks your eyes (in my mind they still haven't fixed the ""video game lighting"" problem that makes an objects look instantly fake), but it's still an opinion a lot of people would get behind.The movie is also filled with interesting turns and developments, lots of cool performances, a great score, and wonderful direction and atmosphere. So where does it go wrong? Where do I differ from the fans? In short, the writing and some of the story elements are pretty weak here. Let's start with some basic character logic. Spoilers here soon.The film reveals to a majority of surviving characters about halfway through that even a single cell of The Thing is capable of entirely assimilating any living being absurdly quickly. Some lip service is made to the idea, but no one really acts like their lives depend on this. They persist in eating together, drinking out of open containers, leaving their faces and sometimes hands uncovered as if they don't care that any contamination is deadly.The movie is also guilty of using the potentially interesting paranoia element simply to manipulate characters like chess pieces on a board. Most of the conversations regarding trust and distrust don't feature any of the kind of dialogue I would expect from people in a situation like this, and instead railroad quickly towards a forced conclusion. It's too darn bad.The last element worth mentioning that lets the film down are The Thing's logic its self. Let's not get into too many of the semantics here: The Thing acts pretty dumb until it's time for it to be not dumb. The first two actions The Thing takes are absolutely against its own nature and goals. 1st, it gets alone time in the very beginning with the dog keeper and, for no reason at all, passes up the opportunity to assimilate him. A new base, no allies, all it needs to do is lick his face or hand and... hold on. It does lick his face much earlier when the Norwegians were crashing, and somehow he isn't infected when he dies? So not only does this whole interaction make a rewatch harder with a big plot hole, but it makes The Thing look pretty dumb.2nd The Thing's big kennel scene is where it blows its cover immediately for no reason. All it needs to do is share a water bowl with all the other dogs, or a meal, or get in a fight where it scratches a few of them, but instead it does something incredibly dumb again.Luckily, The Thing mostly acts smarter as the movie goes on, becoming bone chillingly intelligent in its final act as the movie realizes a thoroughly brilliant ending. The ending got way better for me on a rewatch; it might be the most thoroughly and realistically depressing horror movie ending our there, beating out The Mist for being less fantastical.I thoroughly recommend this film, but I have to call it how I see it too: there are a few typical dumb horror movie tropes at work here. The movie mostly serves its self brilliantly, but I feel it occasionally tosses a monkey wrench in to your potential enjoyment with a bit of bad or forced writing here or there. But, make no mistake, it may just be the best monster movie ever made.",31 December 2023

",9,"It's surprising, in retrospect, that The Thing wasn't better received by contemporary reviews. Granted, it faced unusually stiff theatrical competition in E. T. and Blade Runner, both less than two weeks old, which certainly stole a great deal of its thunder. At the hour of The Thing's opening, Spielberg's family-friendly blockbuster had already established a popular, positive outlook on alien relations (basically the antithesis of The Thing's overwhelming nihilism), while Ridley Scott's sci-fi opus was exploring equally bleak tones and mature, ambiguous themes. There's no room for three films to coexist at the top, particularly ones with such similarities. Public sentiment agreed that John Carpenter's small-scale saga of a fierce, faceless extraterrestrial attack in the Antarctic desolation couldn't hold a candle. Fortunately, hindsight has been more forgiving.What a ride this is. Carpenter leans hard on the suspense, skillfully employing the locale's smothering isolation as amplification in much the same way Scott did with Alien, just a few years prior. The nature of the beast, as an invisible, corrupting force, is a brilliant device for this type of story. Nobody's safe and nobody can be trusted, not even oneself. Late in the crisis, when the team has finally developed a reliable blood test, that fear is palpable. We can see it in their widened eyes and held breath: what if I'm already infected? Their uncertainty intensifies our own, heightening tensions to unbearable levels. In this, Carpenter teaches a master class, and the payoff - a series of lumpy, repulsive creature effects from Rob Bottin - are worth the price we pay. When the alien mass sprouts from its living host, the results are car-crash grotesque, all melted flesh and unnatural deformity. Appropriately powerful and haunting, alien but also eerily familiar, they shock and disgust, every single time.There's no two ways about it: this is a classic. An intelligent, potent, thrilling example of science fiction and horror that's right up there with the best of each genre.

",9,"Revisiting this film I found it really holds up very well. The film opens with invasion and the coming occupation of Warsaw, a family must now decide whether to flee, and if so where to go? Our main character is a middle-class musician, cultured, well dressed, handsome but his world is now turned up side down. The early scenes of the city apartments being emptied, of glass smashing, radio falling silent and distress are all really well directed and acted. We next move now to the Warsaw ghetto and the casual brutality and contempt the occupiers now display to the inhabitants. Our main character is still able to work as a pianist but his life now is looking increasingly precarious. The family fortune dwindles, money has little value anymore. You really have to give high praise to the costumes, props and locations, I really felt myself there living it. This is an English language film but you don't really hear any English accents which at least helps. It has a bit of a desaturated look but it's still very much something shot on film and not at all like some digital films we get now. The story is very much that of the pianist, everything that happens we see through his eyes. The thuggery and terror brought by the Nazis is revolting and shocking. There's a tiny bit of CGI but mostly it's all in camera and I have to give the production values very high praise. At times I did slightly loose track of what year it was, maybe that's deliberate. I also found our main character very passive, there's no mad heroics, no impassioned speeches from him, he's probably too shocked for anything remotely like that. As I said it's very much his story, we have no sense of who's winning or losing the war, no cut aways to generals looking at maps or giving out orders really. There's some great physical acting in here too, our main character's appearance change so much as he lives a more and more hunted and animal like life. He is truly just a survivor in an increasingly dangerous landscape. We see some acts of defiance and resistance, his life though is terribly lonely and he carries with him his love of music throughout his life on the run.",27 December 2023

The film has this weird blend of style and realism, it's a pretty violent film, and characters are tortured for information, there's a real thread of greed and individualism throughout, everyone is ought for themselves in this, trying to get their hands on some stolen gold. The music is simply awesome, it's got to be perhaps my most beloved and memorable music soundtrack that I can think of. The film does a good job in maintaining an era of mystery and sheer magmatism to the Eastwood character, he's a man of few of words but when he speaks people listen. This is a real man's film, there's basically no female characters, set during the US Civil War it manages to use that as a backdrop to the movie. While these 3 men are out to get rich and possibly kill one another doing it there's a level of suffering and death going on around them on a colossal scale as armies clash and men die in their thousands. Angel Eyes makes a great villain yet there's almost no truly good or heroic characters in this movie, any character who is shown as being good like a prostitute, a priest or a dying captain in a POW camp are shown as being unable to be helpless mostly and at the mercy of events, while it's the bad characters who tend to be strong and powerful. It's a film of killers hunted by killers hunted by killers. So improbable too is the accuracy and irony of some of the shooting in this film that it almost begins to border on parody. This is no story of a good sheriff trying to protect his town from bad men and who at the end of the film will need to walk down the town's main avenue or into the bar for a final shootout. The landscape of Spain works really well for this film, the barren dusty landscape with little vegetation and the whitewashed brick houses. As mentioned this is a man's world, violent and dangerous, with lots of double crossing, there's little honour among thieves here. Yet everything is also happening in this heightened, unrealistic almost dreamy way, it's very hard to explain. The Eastwood character goes through great suffering in one scene but is then unaffected for the rest of the movie, he just turns back into the macho mysterious enigmatic character again he was at the start. There's no good sheriff in this movie to step in and sort things out, it's like there's no law at all in many places. It's a warn torn country and it's fitting that it finishes in a graveyard.On a technical level the film looks great, the editing is slick and fast, the cinematography is really well done and probably a bit ahead of it's time.

They blow their blood money on tacky homes, cars and clothes, greedy wives and sleazy girlfriends.Henry's wife gets a voice in this movie too, which is interesting. She willingly chooses this mobster to start a family with, despite the danger, the stress and the trauma it causes to her children (which we see crying a lot).All in all, all of the main characters come across as highly unsympathetic and I found it difficult to understand what kept them in the horror lives they were living.

The most recent Scorsese film that I've reviewed was The Departed, which I've had a good time with but couldn't see it as the masterpiece people claim it is, and I'm pretty sure that I used the same terminology in my review for The Departed as well - yet to make me fall in love with Scorsese's work. I mean, come on, guys, I don't want us to be just friendly faces in the lobby of the building, I want us to be more. *sigh* But jokes aside, let's get into the review.Often considered to be Scorsese's defining masterpiece, Goodfellas is based on a book, which, in its turn, describes the true story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a notorious New-York gangster who started out young. Really young. This movie basically follows his rise and his fall, with a special focus on the relationship he had with two other gangsters - James Conway (Robert De Niro, which is probably the actor most associated with Scorsese) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci).If you find this plot description a little vague, well, it's not a coincidence - this film hardly has a coherent, easy to sum-up story. It's more like a timeline, filled with little stories that paint a bigger picture, than a straightforward, classic storyline. It's not completely random structure-wise, of course. Like I said, it's about the rise and fall, and as the movie progresses the small doses of Henry's life that we get are less glamorous, less shiny, and the so-called gangster lifestyle shows its true, bloody colors.Talking about bloody colors, one thing that I absolutely love here is the cinematography. Out of all the Scorsese films I've seen, this one's handily the best-directed one. I love the use of red and black as main colors in certain scenes, especially when it becomes sort of hazy and surreal because of it. The famous one-shot scene, the dynamic camerawork and editing, the memorable compositions, everything just comes together to create quite a beautiful result. The cinematography makes this movie feel ALIVE, you know what I mean? One of the best aspects of my experience with it. Scorsese undoubtedly knows his craft, and he works with people who know what they're doing as well.The soundtrack is also pretty cool. It's always the same vibe with Scorsese soundtracks, from my experience so far (dad-rock stuff or classic pop hits from the 1950's), but he always has solid ones. I also enjoyed how he handled a pretty big ensemble of characters with enough attention to each so you can feel how big the mafia is and how it surrounds Henry everywhere he goes, but not so much that it would feel tiresome. It's nice, and rather immersive. Cool stuff.I guess that my main issue with this movie is that I wasn't really emotionally invested. This movie is just good enough to be pretty fun while watching, but I never was fully gripped by the plot, never was truly moved or impacted emotionally by watching, except for maybe a few moments here and there. There are some scenes that are iconic and memorable - I like the ""you're a funny guy"" one, the one where a shovel is involved, and the wake-up-darling scenes, but it never passes the threshold, the critical point where it becomes actually powerful. Just pretty good, I guess.One last thing I want to address - I'm having conflicted feelings regarding the way that Henry narrates this film. I feel like it should, on paper, get me more immersed (City of God is my favorite example of a good use of a narrator voiceover), but in reality it just feels a bit...I don't know, flat? It should've had more character, at least, and it was rather dry here compared to how it could've been. It's not bad, and I like the way that some moments are narrated, but something's definitely lacking here.Goodfellas is a dynamic, very well-made film. It looks quite fantastic, it has a large cast of characters that it handles really well, it has its fair share of iconic, memorable moments, and it generally tells a pretty good story. I feel like I wasn't emotionally invested enough to truly love this movie, but I do like it overall. I'm feeling a 7.0/10 on this one.",23 December 2023

The movie is full of raw emotions unlike Disney films which have happy endings and shows the sad cruelty of war impact on innocent people. This movie is definitely not for weak hearted people and if someone can finish the movie without crying, congratulations; you are a robot!Spoilers !!!The movie is about one brother and one sister named Seita and Setsuko who struggle after loosing their parents due to World war 2. Seita is only 14 years old when their parents are gone and had to take the responsibility of his little sister sestsuko aged only 4 years. Seita had to take his sister to his aunt's house as their house got burned down due to bombing by American Jet planes. The aunt was nice to the children at first but showed her true colours after learning about their parents. Seita had to hide their parents' demis in order to protect her sister's innocence and had always stayed with her, played with her and comforted her. Their aunt didn't tolerated this. She's always used to curse them and they even had to cook their own food at such young age.The children had enough of their aunt's cruelty and decided to stay in abandoned bomb shelter and called it their home. At first they were happy and survived alright. At this point we may think that they'll do alright even though the two characters were shown dead at the beginning of the movie. This is the time when the life played a cruel merciless game with them. They had to undergo severe malnutrition due to lack of food and with no proper living necessities. Seita did everything he can. He cared for his sister wholeheartedly and had to do heart wrenching things in order to feed his sister. He had to rob the houses during bombing, had to steal the crops during the night and get caught and had to bear the beatings of the farmer. But he never left his sister with hunger. But The God didn't showed mercy on them. Setsuko was suffering with severe malnutrition and Seita had taken her to the hospital. The doctor didn't treated her as they don't have money and said to feed her good nutritious food and she'll be fine. Seita had withdrawn all the money from her mother's savings account and bought everything that Setsuko liked. But it is too late for Setsuko. She barely had life in her. Seita fed her a piece of watermelon and went to cook the food. Setsuko was gone into the sleep and never woke up again.Seita had tears raining from his eyes. Seita cremated her body the next day with her doll and collected her ashes in the fruit drops box. He has never gone to the cave again. Seita eventually dies due to starvation in a railway station of a city. The Souls of Seita and Setsuko gets united and lived happily exploring the city.Hatoff to Isao Takahata and Studio Ghibli for directing and making this masterpiece. The theme of this movie is not about making you sad but it is about the cruelty suffered by the innocent people due to war especially the children. This movie changes the perception of our ideas towards the war and makes us to be a good person. Everyone should watch this masterpiece atleast once in their lifetime.",5 December 2023

",9,"""Tumbbad"" - An Epic Cinematic Odyssey""Tumbbad"" is a mesmerizing masterpiece that takes the audience on a surreal and haunting journey through the dark corners of human desires, greed, and mythology. Directed by Rahi Anil Barve and Adesh Prasad, this Indian fantasy-horror film, released in 2018, has left an indelible mark on the world of cinema with its unique storytelling, impeccable visuals, and thought-provoking themes.Set against the backdrop of a remote village in Maharashtra, the film introduces us to the enigmatic world of Tumbbad, a place shrouded in mystery and soaked in myth. The narrative is divided into three distinct chapters, each spanning different time periods, and yet seamlessly interwoven to form a coherent and captivating storyline.The film's protagonist, Vinayak Rao, portrayed brilliantly by Sohum Shah, is a complex character who embodies the dualities of human nature. Vinayak is driven by an insatiable greed for the hidden treasure of Tumbbad, a legacy passed down through generations. His journey takes him from the innocence of childhood to the treacherous depths of his obsession, and Sohum Shah's performance is nothing short of spectacular as he convincingly navigates through this transformation.One of the most remarkable aspects of ""Tumbbad"" is its ability to create an immersive atmosphere. The village of Tumbbad, with its decaying buildings and looming shadows, feels like a character in itself. The filmmakers employ intricate production design, haunting cinematography, and a haunting score to transport the audience into this otherworldly realm. The attention to detail in recreating the historical and mythological aspects of the setting is commendable, making Tumbbad an immersive and believable place.The film's screenplay, written by Mitesh Shah, Adesh Prasad, Rahi Anil Barve, and Anand Gandhi, is a masterclass in storytelling. It deftly combines elements of horror, fantasy, and drama, all while maintaining a tight narrative grip. The use of Indian mythology, particularly the story of Hastar, a forgotten deity cursed with insatiable hunger, serves as the central theme of the film. This ancient myth is woven seamlessly into the storyline, providing both a foundation for the narrative and a thought-provoking commentary on the consequences of unbridled greed.One of the most striking aspects of ""Tumbbad"" is its visual brilliance. Cinematographer Pankaj Kumar's work is nothing short of breathtaking. The film's dark and moody palette perfectly complements its themes and adds to the overall sense of foreboding. The use of practical effects and a combination of CGI is seamless, resulting in some truly memorable visual sequences. The scenes involving Hastar are particularly striking, as they blend horror and fantasy in a way that is both terrifying and mesmerizing.Another noteworthy aspect of ""Tumbbad"" is its sound design and music. The film's score, composed by Jesper Kyd, adds an eerie and haunting quality to the narrative. It heightens the tension and suspense, making every moment feel significant. The sound design, which includes the haunting cries of Hastar and the ominous sounds of the village, enhances the overall atmosphere and adds to the film's immersive quality.The film's pacing is deliberate, allowing the audience to soak in the atmosphere and the unfolding drama. It's not a traditional horror film with jump scares; instead, it relies on a slow-building sense of dread that lingers long after the credits roll. This approach might not be for everyone, as some viewers may find the film's runtime of over two hours a bit challenging. However, for those willing to invest their time and attention, ""Tumbbad"" offers a rewarding cinematic experience that lingers in the mind.In addition to its technical and narrative achievements, ""Tumbbad"" also explores profound themes that resonate on a universal level. It delves into the consequences of unchecked greed, the cyclical nature of human desire, and the burden of familial legacies. These themes are portrayed with depth and nuance, prompting viewers to reflect on their own lives and choices.One of the film's strengths is its ability to evoke a wide range of emotions. It can be genuinely terrifying at times, with moments that will send shivers down your spine. It can also be deeply moving, as we witness the tragic consequences of Vinayak's actions and the toll it takes on those around him. This emotional depth adds a layer of complexity to the film, elevating it beyond mere genre cinema.In conclusion, ""Tumbbad"" is a cinematic gem that deserves to be celebrated for its ambition, creativity, and storytelling prowess. It's a film that challenges conventions and takes risks, resulting in a unique and unforgettable viewing experience. From its captivating performances to its haunting visuals and thought-provoking themes, ""Tumbbad"" is a cinematic journey that will leave a lasting impression. If you're a fan of immersive and thought-provoking cinema, ""Tumbbad"" is a must-watch that will continue to haunt your thoughts long after the credits roll.",30 December 2023

",6,"It being October, I'm watching a bunch of horror films, and 'Tumbbad' came unto my radar due to imdb's recommendation system. Since I'm not well versed in Indian cinema, I thought it'd be neat to watch a well-rated Bollywood flick as to subvert any possible expectations.The story and premise behind this horror/monster flick is pretty good. Ancient legends speak of a goddess who bore another 160 million gods (Indian mythology tends to be like that), the first god borne (named Hastar) is a greedy bastage and wants to take all sustenance (gold and wheat in this case) for himself and is shunned and (sort of) banished to the Goddess' womb for it.Vanayak is the main character and the plot follows his journey from his youth to his eventual demise. He finds out the actual location of the Godesses' womb and robs Hastar with some trickery throughout the film.I'd say the actual plot is quite flat, despite the premise. Greed is the obvious theme throughout the proceedings and (almost) every character is thus inflicted with a healthy dose of avarice (exception being the very last scene). And while such characters don't have to be necessarily unsympathetic, I found it hard to sympathize with any of the awful people in the film, which was part of why I didn't enjoy it a lot.Despite the thin plot and unlikable characters, there's a lot of good to be said about the production design and cinematography. Gorgeous shots of Indian landscapes and architecture keep the visuals interesting and while not all the special effects wowed me, I appreciated the scarcity of CGI.Perhaps the biggest problem is that it's not really scary, which is the main thing I'm looking for in a horror film. As such, I can't really recommend this as a scary movie, but it's originality and visuals at least made it memorable.6/10.",20 October 2023

From the beginning, the plot builds tension and continues to do so masterfully until the end.This feature film includes some action scenes, quite well-executed with various cuts and different angles that effectively capture the current moment on screen. However, if you're looking for an action film, I wouldn't say this is the right one. Those seeking this type of plot typically want to see many shooting scenes, and while they do occur here, they're not as frequent as expected because the film focuses more on moments of tension. In contrast, violence is consistently present, whether in torture scenes, murder, or shootouts. I would describe this plot as dramatic, bloody, with a considerable dash of action.It's an almost perfect experience for those seeking intense on-screen tension, a good period film, and numerous references to characters that have shaped history.Personally, I loved the direction, plot, and characters, with a significant highlight on the memorable antagonist.However, upon finishing the movie, I felt that something was missing. I think this film could have delved deeper into the protagonist and their allies. At times, the plot doesn't even seem to have a clear protagonist, as it focuses more on other settings and characters than on the main character. On one hand, this could be considered a negative aspect, but for me, it suited the storyline well, ultimately exploring a bit of everything. It manages to delve into the protagonist, the antagonist, and other characters directly linked to those I mentioned.If I were to define ""Inglourious Basterds"" in one sentence, I would say: A different and incredibly good experience.

Now that the new Exorcist: Believer movie came out, I thought it's the perfect timing for me to see the Exorcist franchise. The original is known to be one of the best horror movies ever made and so my expectations were really high.I have lots of respect for the movie and what the creators made for the genre when they created it back in 1973 but the problem is that most memorable scenes have been either copied or seen by me from clips or other things. So the only new thing left for me was the story in general which was good but didn't completely overwhelm me. The whole shock factor from some of this scenes that made the viewers stomach turn just isn't the same as back in the day, especially if you've seen this much horror. The movie goes for a tense and eerie atmosphere instead of pointless jump scares every few minutes and has some really scary imagery with some deep hitting drama mixed in.

",9,"A truly outstanding film, not just a brilliant horror film, but a brilliant film all round.The film opens in an unexpected way, I was expecting a film about a possession of a American girl but it opens with Arabic voices, a sunset and workers digging in the hot sunlight of Iraq. You think you've put the wrong disk in, it's so unexpected. The cinematography is gorgeous, there's no way this film looks like it was shot way back in 1973. The image looks beautiful in the clear warm light of the Iraq skies. Colours are strong, the picture is sharp, clean and clear. A western man with a haunted look to him supervisors the dig, it's clear he's after something and seems disturbed to discover several demonic looking statues during the dig. Without quite knowing why there's something disturbing about these sequences, the sound is unsettling and something is just not right.Next we get a long slow zoom to a home in the USA, we meet a set of new characters, a mother and daughter, strange noises plague their home, but it seems fair to assume that it might be some rats. The mother is a wealthy actress we learn, her daughter seems to live a carefree happy childhood, and there's lots of love and affection between the two. Without this warm idealised beginning what follows wouldn't be so terrible. The film also it's nicely paced and doesn't rush to get to the horror, it doesn't have a modern sensibility but takes it's time. This affluent setting is contrasted with the rough streets, unruly children and grimy rundown buildings our catholic priest walks down. We learn about his worried attitude towards his solitary mother and his lack of conviction in Catholicism. The production design is superb for both settings. We learn the mother and daughter Regan have recently rented the house they are staying in while away from their California home. Regan it's revealed has been playing with an Ouija board and has met a person called Captain Howdy. You could immediately get into a lot of subtext here, is this an attack on the morals of the rich in America? A family broken up? Is it there atheism they are punished for?What follows is a series of slow escalations. The mother finding her daughter asleep in her bed, complaining her own bed was shaking, the daughter spoiling a party, her personality starting to change, the visits to the hospital, the drugs and treatments not working.At the same time this happens the film also expertly mixes in the experience of other psychiatric patients housed in the same hospital as the priests mother. The film also takes a pretty rational and realistic approach to it's subject matter. Doctor's and shrinks are called in to investigate, they don't just jump to the idea she's possessed. The films does a superb job of transforming the daughter from a cheerful affectionate likeable child into an offensive, wild, profane personality, it seems now there is no way back for her. The colour palette for the film gets increasingly cold, with lots of black, white, grey and a steel blue lighting by the time we get to the finale. The camerawork is also smooth and assured, with a mixture of tripod shots, handheld, tracking shots, this film has it all. The priest is also a boxer, and we see this nicely contrasted with the strength and rage that develops in the daughter. While all this is going on and the story of the priest and daughter are starting to be joined together for the final third we also have a detective investigating a suspicious death which may also be connected to Regan. The probing dialogue and questions, the way he slowly starts to piece together what's happening is all very well done. Other things are left unspoken, we see though the mother's discomfort through her actions, quickly locking the door as soon as he's left. There's always a lot going on. Scenes also sometimes feel safe or happy followed by a sudden shocking escalation of violence, the scenes play on too, keeping you gripped to the film. There's another twists to during the pre-exorcist investigation, we are not quite sure if we can believe what we're being told and neither is the priest. There's also the horrible fear of self inflicted injuries and the fear of being institutionalised. As things seem increasingly tense and desperate our expert priest from the beginning of the film returns for the final big showdown. The sound design is superb in this film, the bangs, the knocks, the swirling wind, the crackling of the head, cries which sound more animal like than human. It's all excellent for 1973 and it's technical limitations. The film is also about faith, doubt, accepting your limitations and flaws yet still striving to overcome them. The final 20 minutes does not disappoint and again it's full of the conflict and twists you'd hope for, the film keeps you guessing right up until it's final scene over it's outcome. In the end the film is so well written, the realism, the constant struggle, the escalation of stakes and horror and the way it comes so unpredictably.",27 December 2023

We meet Father Merrin (Max von Sydow) looking a bit peaky on an archeological dig in Iraq. We're kept guessing, but it's clear he's found some things amongst all the dust and stone that make him uneasy. Cut to America, where actress Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) and her daughter Regan (Linda Blair) are about to have their world turned upside down, whilst Tubular Bells plays in the background. Father Karras (Jason Miller) is also a bit lost. Working as a psychiatrist for the church, keeping an eye on his elderly mother. He tells her he's fine, but he's clearly not. These are the cornerstones in a slow opening act. Horrors often like to set the pulse racing early on, but The Exorcist will ask for your patience. Chris is hearing noises in the loft though and Regan isn't sleeping well. That's just the start of it. As things get more extreme with Regan, regular psychiatry and modern medicine is ditched and Karras is called in. Only after Lieutenant Kinderman (Lee Cobb) has been snooping around though. I don't think it's much of a spoiler to divulge that Regan is possessed. The scenes in which she's flailing around on the bed, screaming and swearing are genuinely terrifying. Still 50 years on, but what makes The Exorcist great is not the effects with levitating children, it's the slow eerie building narrative weaved through the supporting cast. This is what drives it and makes you believe. For if you don't, well you've just got some freaky scenes with no substance. Karras isn't an exorcist, but he's convinced enough to go down the rabbit hole and call in Father Merrin. It's showtime and Max von Sydow is the guy you want in your corner. He not only looks every bit the demon slayer, but he nails the performance too. Make no mistake though, for all the great performances, Burstyn, Miller, this is Linda Blair's film. She might be caked in make up and if you're so inclined you could laugh at the absurdity of her role, but she's still brilliant. The sheer physicality of what's asked of her is pretty full on and although Friedkin is inventive with the camera, you still need the raw footage and Blair has it covered. Some people adore this film and I can see why, in many ways it's flawless, but it's foolish to say watching it 50 years on its not weakened a little. Only a little though.

Well, there's a sequel out this year drumming up new interest in the subject, plus a 50th Anniversary 4K UHD Blu-ray edition of the original, and there's a remote chance that somehow, somebody somewhere has never seen ""The Exorcist."" Maybe I can give them some insight, should they deign to read my review.The generations of moviegoers that have come along since it was released have been jaded by increasingly more graphic and violent depictions in movies, so ""The Exorcist"" isn't going to shock them and may even be considered tame. But when it was released, no one had ever seen anything like it in a movie theater. The demon's vulgarity, the grotesque substances and profanity pouring out of its mouth, the bizarre and disturbing supernatural manifestations freaked audiences out and overshadowed other aspects of what is a fine, well crafted piece of filmmaking. The imitations that followed dwelt only on the strange, the shocking and the gory - - basically, the bad and the ugly without the good. Most of today's horror films are just a succession of jump scares, the characters just props linking a series of cheap thrills.Not so with ""The Exorcist."" Here, the focus is on the people who are affected by the girl's possession, beginning with her distraught mother (Ellen Burstyn), who is at her wit's end trying to get help. There's a young priest (Jason Miller ) struggling with his faith, an older priest who has prior experience in this area (Max von Sydow) and a bemused, Columbo-like detective (Lee J. Cobb) who provides some small measure of lightheartedness to the proceedings. Of course, we can't forget the girl herself (Linda Blair), a victim of forces way beyond her own or anyone else's understanding, who was already troubled enough by her parents' separation and their mutual hostilities, and has turned to an Ouija board and an ""imaginary"" friend for comfort.But none of it would've been realized without the perfect storm of William Friedkin directing, and William Peter Blatty scripting. Their collaboration produced a unique cinematic excursion into the religious supernatural, while keeping itself grounded in mundane reality. That juxtaposition is what creates the uneasiness in us, as we wonder, ""Could it happen...?"" They created something rare in this genre, a tale told with depth and intelligence that also delivers the scares, although it is not really a horror movie in the strict sense; Blatty has said that he never intended to write a scary horror story, but rather a supernatural detective story that makes us ask, ""Is she possessed, or not?""The reason I can't give it a solid 10 stars is because I'm not entirely comfortable with an aspect of the film's denouement, one that I can't expound on without adding a spoiler. Also, in the years since its debut, re-edits have emerged, like the director's cut and ""the version you've never seen,"" etc., and it's confusing as to which should be considered a definitive version. The so-called spider walk scene was restored, of which there are multiple creepier versions that can be viewed on YouTube, but the one inserted in the recut movie should have been left on the cutting room floor, as it adds nothing to the narrative, seems out of place, and looks kind of silly.Nonetheless, ""The Exorcist"" stands alone. It takes its time unfolding the story and develops believable characters before it hits you with a one-two-three punch you will never forget. If you have no patience and demand instant gratification, this probably isn't the movie for you. But if you want to watch an excellent film, follow an actual story, AND be rewarded with a one of a kind payoff during the climax and finale, by all means spend a couple of hours watching what Ray Bradbury once called the finest horror movie ever made.",24 November 2023

By contrast the Catholic clergy are reluctant to perform and suffer from appalling stage fright when cajoled into action and there's no chance of repeat performances.Every adult character has copious problems and they are all made up, and photographed, and lit to be ugly and unappealing visually.The harshness of this imagery contrasts with the lurid colours of the demonic possession which oozes rank and festering colour versus the muted imagery for the human cast.The acting is styled in a similarly muted manner, which has clearly been directed across the board from all the actors, and is reflected in the low key casting of most roles.The sound mix is a major plus with average ambient sound effects and dialogue pick up, but impactful special sound effects and scoring which amounts to a powerful influence.The overall conclusion is that the demonic entity is loud, lurid, luscious and lewd, colourful and charismatic whereas the humans are all the opposite. Barely alive, hardly animated, barely coloured.Everything detailed maxes out the impact of the demon inside the girl. Here the film has one of its most shocking values as the sexually orientated explicitness is portrayed through a 12 year old.The second cause for unease is the medical attention that the child must endure, which is unsettling for those who are squeamish about medicine and hospitals. This is in contrast to the hands on and human efforts of the Catholic priests who are called in after the failures of modern medicine.I rate at 6/10 and really, a lot of points are lost in my rating due to the rough edges that are obvious in many scenes and sequences, and due to the inefficiency of the narrative; I watched the theatrical cut many years ago and just now watched the extended directors cut: both are just inefficient storytelling structures; the editing could be much tighter, and the drabness of the human cast leaves them unfulfilling as characters.I recommend to supernatural horror fans and fans of kids baiting stiff adults.

",7,Some excellent performances. And a decent cast of actors. With Brandos Gravitas hard to dislike. Sometimes the soundtrack can be physically off putting. But occasionally the music treats you with Valkyries and The Stones which is enjoyable. I would probably argue it is Horror before it is a war movie as the brutality and graphic depictions can be pretty grim. Similar vibes to Event Horizon on that front. Thought it was quite hard to understand the dialogue as it was loud and manic quite often making deciphering sentences difficult at times. But to be fair the dialogue is only marginally important. The story is also not overly important. Understanding the main plot is a must for most films. But watching the characters personal decents into their own madness and imagining the conditions which lead to horrendous circumstances becoming the accepted norm is where I feel the flms main objective lies and it does this reasonably well. I gave the movie a 7 as I was reasonably entertained and enjoyed it in spells. I did find it a little disjointed and unsettling at times and that's not really my idea of enjoyable viewing. But as its a well loved Movie. I can understand that this sort of artistic direction appeals to a large audience. Ticked off the Bucket Watch List.,25 November 2023

The main difference between those two separate films is the disproportion from Francis Ford Coppola's point of view in terms of angle vision concerning the conflict. Nothing in common, actually, with Michael Cimino's movie. In the latest, you could feel some empathy for the characters, you could feel close to them, they were like so many Americans who lived this pure tragedy, this shock for the country, for which so many of them never overcame the trauma. Here, in APOCALYPSE NOW, it's entirely different, everything is totally crazy, enormous - like first Marlon Brando bigger than life - an oversized film with the famous Wagnerian symphony - the so widely known helicopter attack on the Vietnamese village. Nothing is genuinely real in this story inspired from real events. It seems to be the reflection of a director's madness, as the Colonel Kurz. It's for me the most crazy, lunatic war film ever made.

",10,"-Final Cut; 4K Restoration-A true cinematic translation of the War Is Hell phrase. Continual barrages, both literal and of smoke and fire, while the sun dives towards the horizon to escape the madness and boots trudge through the glistering mud. One of the most 'tangible' films ever made, which can be in large attributed to the insane production value. Seeing a 5-second shot with dozens of extras and a couple helicopters in the sky or giant constructions violently exploding are far from rare. It's in part why, for example, the Wagner sequence is so arresting, though of course there are many elements at play. I guess it's understandable that some read it as pro-war/America, but when those chants kick in as the choppers move landward with the ocean waves, it should become instantly clear how that patriotism moreso stands for delusions of grandeur, acting like a source of divine intervention. This is further illustrated by Kilgore, who likes to stand tall when everyone ducks and seems more interested in bringing surfing to Vietnam than the battlefield he is currently in the middle of, in a sense acting out an even dumber version of the White Man's Burden.Coppola also cleverly communicates the mental collapse of the soldiers. Whereas so many Vietnam films resort to a soldier crying and hopelessly yelling that he can't take it no more, Apocalypse Now employs a much more subtle and psychological approach, often utilizing film form itself like with the brilliant uses of overlapping shots to convey a fragmented mind. There are some noticable tropes (though that isn't much of a problem considering this was one of the earliest Vietnam films), in particular the narration stands out, but unlike, for instance, The Thin Red Line, it's well spaced out and never feels pretentious. Overall, though, it is much more concerned with non-verbality, conjuring an atmosphere worthy of being called hell on earth. Not that it'd have to worry about words: dialogue is precise, memorable (what smell did he like again?) and consistently delivered with excellence. Martin Sheen is a powerhouse, but Marlon Brando is close to stealing the show. His screentime is little and is usually spent in lengthy and dark close-ups with low-key lighting, which reflects just how confident Coppola must've been in his performance (unsurprising given The Godfather) and is truly all that was needed. Throughout the entire 3-hour runtime there was a near constant stream of people going in and out of the theatre for a quick bathroom break, but when Brando was on screen? Utter immobility. Having your performance be the climax of a 2-hour buildup is tough, but he makes it look easy.Truly a shame about that plantation section - courtesy of the Final Cut - that occupies an awkward position as both a damper on the otherwise flawless pacing and as simply being subpar (or at the very least, not on the same level as everything else) because otherwise this might be as good as it gets.

The film gives you a sense of chaos that is unnerving. Unlike other war movies that portray various things, what makes this movie unique is its directing, acting, writing, and cinematography.The directing by Francis Ford Coppola is remarkable. It feels like you are in the middle of the war, feeling confused, shocked, and frightened. The writing is also excellent and keeps you engaged for the three-hour movie. The cinematography is creepy and adds to the overall experience of watching the film, capturing all the madness around you, even when everything looks calm.The acting is spine-chilling. Marlon Brando's performance, in particular, is his last outstanding one, playing a delusional and unbalanced colonel. Martin Sheen's incredible performance allows you to see everything through his eyes, experience all the insanity he is going through, and yet cheer for him to achieve his goal. Robert Duvall's portrayal of a commander with his bizarre battle strategies, such as playing music to alert the enemy that he is coming, is also impressive. Supporting performances by a young Laurence Fishburne, Sam Bottoms, and Frederic Forest, who all captured the attitudes of many soldiers at that time without being cliché, were fantastic. Cameos by Dennis Hopper and Harrison Ford are also noteworthy.I highly recommend this movie. It delivers a message, and everyone involved in creating it is at their best.

",10,"Apocalypse Now, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is a mesmerizing cinematic masterpiece that takes viewers on an unforgettable odyssey through the depths of madness and despair. Released in 1979, this film stands as a timeless exploration of the consequences of war, expertly crafted with a vision that transcends the genre's boundaries. With a gripping narrative and stunning visuals, the movie immerses its audience in a world where reality blurs with the chaotic horrors of war.One of the most compelling elements of Apocalypse Now is the brilliant use of Willard's voice-over narration, penned by the talented Michael Herr. The narration not only provides insights into the psyche of the protagonist but also serves as a window into the madness that ensues as he journeys up the Nung River. Herr's writing infuses Willard's narration with a poetic quality, capturing both the physical and psychological turmoil experienced by the characters. It becomes the thread that ties together the fragmented events, deepening the film's intensity and giving a poignant perspective to the turmoil unfolding on screen.Coppola and his collaborator, George Lucas, intentionally aimed to create a film that transcended the traditional war genre. In their pursuit of an archetypal tale, they transformed Apocalypse Now into a modern-day Greek Myth, an allegorical journey that examines the psychological descent into madness at all levels. By blurring the boundaries between reality and hallucination, they craft vivid portraits of characters who are grappling with their own inner demons as they navigate the unforgiving landscape of war. This approach elevates the film beyond a simple depiction of a conflict; instead, it becomes a timeless exploration of humanity's capacity for darkness.The visual mastery displayed in Apocalypse Now further enhances its status as a cinematic landmark. The breathtaking cinematography by Vittorio Storaro captures the ethereal beauty and chaos of the Vietnamese landscape, juxtaposing moments of calm with explosive violence. Deliberate use of lighting and color schemes heightens the atmospheric tension, immersing the audience in a world filled with dread and uncertainty.From the exceptional performances of the cast, particularly Martin Sheen's riveting portrayal of Captain Willard, to the haunting soundtrack that seamlessly blends with the narrative, every element of Apocalypse Now contributes to its status as an extraordinary piece of filmmaking. Coppola's meticulous direction and dedication to exploring the human psyche set it apart, making it a true work of art that challenges conventional storytelling and leaves a lasting impact on anyone who watches it.Apocalypse Now stands as a testament to the power of cinema to capture the complexities of the human experience. With its exploration of madness and the timeless themes it tackles, this film is not just a war movie but a profound exploration of the human condition. It transfixes viewers, challenging them to confront the darkness lurking within, and in doing so, solidifying its place as a true classic.",30 October 2023

",8,"Based on Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, Apocalypse Now (1979), produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, and co-written by Francis Ford Coppola and John Milius is arguably the best action and war film of all time. Set in Vietnam in 1970, Apocalypse Now trails the hellish journey up-river endured by Captain Willard (Martin Sheen), as he seeks to find and destroy Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a man who we learn has gone crazy after seeing the savage truths of the American strategy in Vietnam and is perhaps best described as the literal heart of darkness. Accompanied by Air Cavalry Officer Kilgore (Robert Duvall), and a nameless, spirited freelance photographer (Dennis Hopper), we watch as Willard, an already emotionally unstable man, unravels more and more due to the chaos and horrors experienced during the journey. The farther up the river they travel, the crazier things get. This film stirs up such a range of emotions. Initially, I felt awe inspired over the incredible cinematography and in addition to such magnificent shots is the skillful acting which made for such fascinating and memorable characters. As the film proceeds to the second and third acts however, the mood changed from awe to dread - a feeling this film captures quite perfectly. There's so much to say about the images: the quick shot where Martin Sheen's painted face surfaces from the water at night; the entrance to Kurtz's village and his monologue that follows perfectly depicts the horrors and madness of war as well as the fear, loneliness, and isolation. I physically felt all this more and more with each scene. Moreover, the immersive sound experience stood up to the impressively vivid visuals and did well to reflect the mood of war. Though Coppola has explicitly stated it's not an antiwar film, the theme of the nature of evil, power, and the soul crushing impact of war on the human psyche aligns with the high criticism of the Vietnam war coming out of Hollywood at the time, and certainly seems particularly concerned with revealing the atrocities of the Vietnam war in the name of democracy and freedom. So, if you're looking for your average war time movie, this isn't it. However, while I will say it lacks a definitive plot, if I'd still recommend this film due to the incredible performances, the advanced level of creativity of each scene and the theme related to the madness of war.",21 October 2023

",10,"The first collaboration of writing duo Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac seemed an ideal vehicle for Alfred Hitchcock but by all accounts he narrowly missed acquiring the rights and it was to become 'Les Diaboliques' under the direction of Henri-Georges Clouzot. As Hitchcock later filmed their 'D'entre les morts' as 'Vertigo' the authors could be said to have hit the jackpot twice.Both directors of course were masters of their craft and had a similar approach to their material in terms of storyboarding at the pre-production stage, in detailing every camera movement and the blocking of every scene. Hitchcock and his adaptor Alex Coppel watched Clouzot's film on many occasions whilst preparing 'Vertigo' and the influence on 'Psycho' is there for all to see.In contrast to the open-air suspense of 'Le Salaire de la Peur' Clouzot has here given us an enclosed, claustrophobic setting in which the rundown school building mirrors the moral degeneracy of the protagonists.Paul Meurisse, one of his country's finest actors, excels even by his standards as the utterly loathsome Michel whilst the strapping and sensual Simone Signoret as Nicole makes all the other blonde bombshells look positively anaemic. A perfect contrast is offered by the petite Vera Clouzot, the director's wife, as Christine, terrorised by Michel, tortured by Catholic guilt and whose fate in the film still has the power to shock. It is bitterly ironic that this lovely artiste was fated to die from a heart attack. By far the most interesting character, for this viewer at any rate, is the Commissaire Fichet of Charles Vanel, an obvious precursor to Colombo with his rumpled demeanor, old raincoat and cigar. This is another in the gallery of unforgettable characters created by Vanel in an astonishingly long career and it cannot be coincidental that when Hitchcock made 'To catch a Thief' he cast Vanel as Commissaire Bertrani.Although the film is topped and tailed by the music of Georges van Parys, it is the lack of music throughout plus the superb editing that intensifies the suspense whilst the pervading seediness is captured by the greyness of Armand Thirard's cinematography. Almost seventy years on it remains an indisputed masterpiece of its type despite an ending that stretches credibility to the utmost.It is said that a work of art reflects its creator and what this says about Monsieur Clouzot one shudders to think but Mme Signoret has offered a rare insight: 'He has to work in a constant ambience of crisis. He has to be depressed, he has to be sad and expects all his artistes and technicians to share his sorrow completely.'",30 November 2023

And it was necessary in order for the second part to be as shocking and thrilling as it is. Everything here happens for a reason.

Even stating that the film has a 'twist-ending' would be a spoiler, especially to modern viewers who have come to expect one, but 'Diabolique' (which preceded 'Psycho' by 5 years) was one of the founding examples of the now familiar (and often strained) genre. Like many of its ilk, the storyline relies on having an 'unreliable perspective' (which of course is part of the twist) but the plot elements are consistent and logical in both the ostensible and hidden narratives. Cleverly, a well-developed 'red herring' (noisy plumbing and nosey tenants) is included that gives viewers the satisfaction of 'foreseeing' the unravelling of the women's deadly plot (and which becomes irrelevant at the climatic 'reveal'). The cast, including Véra Clouzot the pretty but fragile wife Christine, Simone Signoret as the tough lover Nichole, and Paul Meurisse as the cruel, philandering Michael, is very good and the only weakness in the principal roles is a clumsy exchange that serves to explain what actually happened to the viewers before the somewhat abrupt closing scene. Tension is built effectively, especially through Christine's mounting terror, and the moody mise-en-scène and cinematography is outstanding.

",10,"What it lacks in the piercing tension or suspense that characterize some of the filmmaker's other works, it makes up for with strong disquiet and nervous energy that's kept at a constant low boil - slowly but surely rising to a minor but pervasive sense of horror. Michel is so plainly monstrous, played with utmost toxicity by Paul Meurisse, that Christina and Nicole are readily sympathetic despite the conspiracy. Christina's delicate condition, indecisiveness, and extreme anxiety, and Nicole's sheer intensity, determination, and force of personality, are by themselves enough to make the picture deeply compelling even if the narrative didn't take the dark turns that it does; Véra Clouzot and Simone Signoret inhabit their respective roles with wholehearted emotional depth that's tremendously gratifying as a viewer. Factor in the haunting undertones that define the mystery of pretty much the entire second half, and 'Les diaboliques' is without question a gripping, gnawing masterpiece of quiet atmosphere and soft dread that remains an essential classic even almost seventy years later.Georges Van Parys' score is what first greets us over the opening credits with chords so grim and fierce that rather invokes a feeling of horror all by itself - recalling, for example, Georges Delerue's work on 'L'important c'est d'aimer,' or Jean Prodromidès' music for 'Danton.' Then, shrewdly, that score disappears for the vast majority of the runtime. There's no need for it, as the story speaks for itself, and deftly crafts those hair-raising genre chills all on its own merits. Careful scene writing certainly feeds into that, laying in more details to add to the uneasy tone; I need hardly repeat that Christina and Nicole as written, and specifically as portrayed by Clouzot and Signoret, are essential to making this as great as it is. Meanwhile, it's just as noteworthy that as filmmaker Henri-Georges Clouzot again collaborates here with screenwriter Jérôme Géronimi as he did with 1953's 'The wages of fear,' also returning is cinematographer Armand Thirard. Between Clouzot's impeccable, wonderfully smart orchestration of shots and scenes as director, and Thirard's shrewd, calculated photography, 'The wages of fear' was shaped with no few strokes of outright brilliance to fill it with heavy suspense once all necessary introductions and exposition were out of the way. Here, that same combination of skills means 'Les diaboliques' is flush with unsettled airs and a harrowing vibrancy suggesting not just Alfred Hitchcock but the Vincent Price, Hammer Films, or John Carpenter.This has a sterling reputation and I certainly assumed I'd enjoy it, especially having loved some of Clouzot's other movies. And still I'm taken with just how good this is. To some extent I had my doubts about the long-standing application of the ""horror"" label, but it turns out that is a very apt descriptor after all, to my pleasure, as it thrives on splendid unnerving ambience. Even at that I think it stays well enough outside the common boundaries of that more far-flung genre that even folks who generally stay away from horror will find this more to their liking. When all is said and done I rather think this is pretty much a must-see, for it handily proves its worth over these two hours, is very well done in every regard, and absolutely holds up so many years later. Just as a matter of personal preference this won't appeal equally to all, yet as far as I'm concerned 'Les diaboliques' is a terrific classic that continues to deserve all its mighty celebration.",24 June 2023

",7,"The film starts in New York and is slow at first, an attractive young couple find and move into a new apartment. We learn a little about their desires and aspirations. There's some really good realism throughout these early scenes, we feel like a fly on the wall. Also the dialogue is nice and natural too, it doesn't sound too polished or scripted. The film is slow, we gradually meet more characters and begin to delve more into the urban environment of the characters. Slowly a change does start to come over our main character. She loses much of her energy and warmth and cheerfulness. The film starts to make you feel a bit paranoid and you get a creeping sense of unease. It's all very well executed. It is not difficult to get frustrated with the main character, it's so obvious there's something going on but she is so behind the viewer it's frustrating to watch at times. The film though does have lots of nice themes and subtext you can delve into. The costumes are all very adult, the men all wear suits and the Rosemary's dress style also changes over the course of the film. There's one really good tense scene involving a phone box which I liked a lot. Also a heatwave adds to oppression are main character feels. The film I suppose could be seen as a metaphor for the fear over the loss of control during pregnancy women may feel. There's not jump scares in the film, nothing screaming at you to get your attention, no sudden jolts of loud music and cats jumping out of cupboards like modern horror. For something which came out back in the 60s it's aged very well and must have been quite shocking when it came out for a lot of people who saw it. It nicely captured the sense of urban paranoia and uncertainty about the state of modern life and values in an America that seemed to be losing it's mind. The very notion of the family was under fire like never before. The performances are all really terrific every one. The film is also as much as what you don't see as what you do. Everything we see happens from Rosemary's perspective. All in all a very classy, smart, well directed film. While I find the premise kind of far fetched and the weight of the film can be heavy overall I still rate it very highly.",26 December 2023

",10,"'Rosemary's Baby' is remembered as one of the greatest and most important horror movies of all-time, and for good reason, it's a masterful example of horror realism, featuring a combination of unnerving psychological terror, strong storytelling and most importantly it's a critique on society that deals with heavy themes that are still relevant to this day. This movie is a firm classic of the horror genre plain and simple.The Plot = A young couple Guy Woodhouse (John Cassavetes) and his wife Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) move into an old apartment building where they find themselves surrounded by strange neighbours and soon enough Rosemary becomes pregnant and that's where things become even more unsettling.A masterpiece of suspense and perfectly directed by Roman Polanski who expresses realism in how he visually tells the story and in what the story's about by tapping into our real fears about religion, loss of control and the aspect of female pregnancy. While most horror films focus on blood and gore, this relies on a slow build of narrative tension, precise character portrayals, social commentary, and paranoia. The atmosphere is eerie and full of dread thanks to the fantastic cinematography and fluid camera work that brings everything to life.Mia Farrow gives a perfect performance as Rosemary with her natural demure and fragility appearance that's central to her character, perfectly conveying believability, and sympathy in what's perhaps her greatest role of her entire career. John Cassavetes is equally impressive in his role as the husband Guy and delivers superb menace and intrigue to his role. Ruth Gordon delivers an iconic steal stealing performance as the neighbour managing to be both disturbing and humorous at the same time and well deserved her Oscar win.Overall 'Rosemary's Baby' is a thoughtful and yet intriguing horror masterpiece that should be viewed by everyone at least once in a lifetime.",18 November 2023

Or is it all in her head? Or is it something much bigger than she could possibly imagine?Directed by Roman Polanski who also has directed films like The Tenant, The Fearless Vampire Killers and Repulsion; While also being produced by William Castle of whom I didn't expect to see in the film credits, Rosemary's Baby is often helmed as one of the greatest horror films ever made and its easy to see why.Despite some of the monster effects, which are only seen briefly, having aged not the greatest, the rest of the film relies heavily upon suspense, tension, fantastic acting and a slow burn with a very strong reveal that can still pack a punch even if you know it's coming just due to the actor's ability to portray immense emotions of shock, dread and sheer horror.I honestly don't really care for anyone's acting job in this film but that of Mia Farrow's as she is the one that made each scene so impactful with her stellar performance and ability to be seriously convincing.The score heightens the dread and makes every scene of hers to an even more powerful level.It all comes down the execution and execution of it all is pretty stellar.",2 November 2023

Its pacing may seem as an issue to some, but it certainly pays off with a bone-chilling climax that will leave you contemplating the movie far long after viewing. This remains to be a prime example of what good psychological/satanic horror should be, I only hope its legacy lives on as inspiration to the future of horror directors. Rosemary's Baby is one of the best horror films of all time not because it is one of the scariest, but because of how confident it is in its horror.

",10,"WHTBJ is a film of pessimistic theme. It ends in doubt. It doesn't clarify the ending, may be good or may be bad. But the runtime of the film is all about misunderstanding, about jealousy, about revenge for no valid reason exceptpersonal vengeance, about fear. The film is excellent in show casing the sentiments of fear, how one sibling could be so brutal with another, how one sibling lives her life in fear for an uncertain amount of time. The film just excels in all these aspects. The fear and brutality is outstandingly depicted. In summary the film is pessimistic though and the the contents are mainly about negative relationship between two siblings. It ends in one sibling getting attention by the police and the other lying in sand without any references to whether dead or alive.So I think personally that it is one those films who have succeeded in showing realistic horror theme in movies. A masterpiece, so to say in real sense. We all comes across such horrifying situation in lives and this film reminds us of those fearful moments, or atleast the possibility of its various results. Technically a well to do movie, progresses in a fast paced connecting every characters and its dialogues in a proper manner with no loose ends. Both Betty and Joan are excellent in their roles. Other casts are good too. The films doesn't go directly from childhood issues to adults, it slightly refers to childhood and jumps straight to the adult lives citing reasons for jealousy. This indicates the imperfect narrations, nevertheless it doesn't lose the grip of the flow, the grip of the events captivating the viewers.Summing the film is worth watching if you want to connect yourself with realistic horror theme. A horrific tale of sibling rivalry and the unbelievable but may be true output of such psychotic behaviors. On a scale of 100 it is a 98, putting under the pessimistic collection.",13 November 2023

",8,"There's a certain allure to ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"" that transcends the silver screen. This psychologically gripping film, reminiscent of ""Sunset Blvd."", delves into the haunting obsession with fame among aging actresses. Yet, it delves even deeper into the venomous rivalry between two sisters.At the start of the film, Baby Jane (Bette Davis) is introduced as a child star. Her stage performances with her father bring her fame and financial gain for the family. However, Jane's disposition turns sour, leading her to torment her sister Blanche (Joan Crawford). Years later, the roles are reversed. Blanche achieves Hollywood success while Jane fades into oblivion. A car accident leaves Blanche paralyzed and reliant on Jane's care in a mansion purchased by Blanche.Jane spirals into alcoholism and harbors resentment towards the sister she now tends to. When Blanche decides to sell the house, Jane's sanity unravels. As the tension escalates, Jane holds Blanche captive and subjects her to physical and psychological torture. During this time, Jane revisits grandiose fantasies, hiring a pianist to practice singing once more. The film takes a suspenseful and delusional turn, akin to Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", immersing viewers in Jane's psychological journey and perspective. ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"" could well be the headline the next day, questioning the transformation of a beloved child into a murderous figure.Robert Aldrich, a master in this genre, showcases his skill in using color and light to create impressions. A scene that particularly stood out was when Jane begins to sing ""I've Written a Letter to Daddy"". Aldrich places her in darkness, revealing the terrifying contours of her face. As the song concludes, Jane steps into the light, and the visage of aging and decay manifests like a nightmare, eliciting a horrifying scream. The majority of the film unfolds within the house-Blanche's tidy and bright bedroom, Jane's grimy kitchen, and the rehearsal room with a large reflecting mirror. Aldrich know how to transform these confined spaces into characters themselves through composition, shadow play in black and white frames, and choice of angles, creating an intense atmosphere that resonates with internal emotions and fears, adding weight to the psychological intensity.However, the most intriguing aspect of the film lies beyond the screen, within the relationship between the two lead actresses, Bette and Joan. Usually, it's wise to separate external matters from a work to fully appreciate it, but in this case, that very connection elevates the cinematic experience. Baby Jane is the sole film where this duo shared the screen, and their deep-seated hatred and animosity towards each other in real life only amplify its value.Bette and Joan, despite the highs and lows in their careers, remained prominent figures of their generation, holding both fame and fortune. Despite this, the two actresses regarded each other as mortal enemies. The enmity endured for a lifetime. Thus, it's a mystery how Aldrich managed to cast them together in Baby Jane. It's likely because they saw in the script the intense sibling rivalry between the Hudson sisters.There were rumors during filming. In the scene where Jane drags Blanche across the floor, Joan reportedly placed rocks in her pockets for added weight. In another scene where Jane kicks Blanche, Bette allegedly kicked Joan harder than necessary, causing her injury. While all these are hearsay, it's hard to deny that the seamless fusion of real life and the script allowed both actresses to delve deeply into their roles.Similar to Jane's persona in the film, Bette seemed to harbor deeper-rooted bitterness. Her talent wasn't confined to the abhorrence she channeled towards her on-screen sister; it resonated from the real-life events that positively influenced her portrayal. She adeptly conveyed both madness and obsessive intensity, capturing the luster of her past glory. When she dances to the tune of ""I've Written a Letter to Daddy"" on the piano, her enraptured expression is evident in her sinister yet pitiable smile. Her doll-like dress, her endearing childlike movements contrasting with her aged and contorted form, evoke shivers. All of this combines with the innocence and dedication Jane carried from her childhood, as well as her anguish. We feel it all. It's a scene that lingers in memory.In the final scene, when a once-feared rivalry finds reconciliation as Jane buys ice cream for her sister, Jane transforms into a vision of beauty and benevolence, a semblance of the innocence she lost in her childhood.""You mean all this time, we could have been friends?"", Jane wonders.Regrettably, Bette and Joan in real life never experienced such a resolution. The feud between them transcended the boundaries of cinema, becoming a saga that rivals the most dramatic plots ever written. It reminds us that cinema is not merely a canvas for storytelling but a mirror reflecting the tumultuous lives and relationships of those who grace its stage.In the end, we are left with a lingering question: What ever happened to Bette and Joan? Their rivalry and its indelible impact have become part of the cinematic lore of Hollywood's golden age. While the answers may remain elusive, their legacy lives on, and ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"" remains an enduring testament to their tumultuous relationship-an enigma that continues to fascinate, captivate, and beguile audiences for generations to come.",1 September 2023

So we understand that Jane was a star but really get forgotten when she becomes an adult and we have Blanche the sister who didnt have the same attention younger but have it in her adult time. Its kind of a nice dynamic of the relationship of the sisters; one is desperate for attention, the other just want to enjoyed her fame but cant because of the accident. Its kind of brilliant how they made things confusing: from the beginning we can only think that sister did the accident because of her jealousy or something else. But this is kind of event really was a little bit subtle (we dont really know what really happened until the end). We have also Jane who become more and more toxic: her behavior become really dangerous for Blanche and get pretty soon violent and hard. So we have a possessive sister who abuse the situation of Blanche and try to live her life. And it will be more and more dramatic (the murder of Elvira). But the most unexpected revelation come at the end when Blanche revealed that she wanted to kill her sister but instead missed her and made her disabled; thats why it kind of complex and everything get contrasted because of that. Really unexpected. Of course it dont excuse the behavior of Jane and how violent she was. But this statement at the end we kind have a different opinions now of the sisters and made us realised that none of them are innocent in the story. And it was pretty brilliant. Of course we have the talks of money, fame, jealousy, the attempt to get famous again, the relationship between family.

",5,"One of the most demented classic-era movies produced in Hollywood, this film concerns two past-their-prime film-star sisters (played by aging stars Joan Crawford and Bette Davis) tormenting each other in a rundown Hollywood mansion. Despite being produced in the 60s it's fairly disturbing, maybe even more effective for coming out before the onslaught of 70s sleaze and trash that would conquer American film. There's a stately formality to the filmmaking even at its most absurd... The over-the-top makeup is especially noticeable: Crawford, with her giant eyebrows, looks a bit like a Russian peasant, while Davis-her pale face slathered with dark, garish makeup-looks more like an exhumed corpse. This face alone is either the movie's greatest horror effect or visual gag, probably depending on the viewer.Director Robert Aldrich is certainly no Hitchcock, though he can play quite dirty and suffuses the entire film with that trademark Aldrich nastiness. He manages a few scenes of genuine suspense, as well as an effective atmosphere of crippled helplessness. It's too bad that these are nearly always undercut by the overall ridiculousness of the characters, who rarely act like normal human beings, let alone sensible ones. Throughout his entire career Hitchcock never made the mistake of trying to wring suspense out of a character's stupidity, but Aldrich does exactly that with a woefully inept climax involving the maid, one that had me slapping my forehead in irritation. Some twenty minutes later the movie ends on a grotesque note of madness and death, and that's it. There's nothing illuminating about this film; you can't fault Aldrich for squeezing every bit of juice possible from the concept of a deranged former child star, but his storytelling lacks impact.

Bette Davis, who had one of the greatest careers in Hollywood history during the 30's and in particular, the '40's, hadn't been in anything of importance or prominence since her greatest triumph, All About Eve in 1950. Her outrageously bold performance here put her back on the map and many thought she would win her third Oscar, but it was not to be as the voters went elsewhere. But Davis really works hard to bring this over the top role to life and she is truly a treat to watch here. Unfortunately, this hit film about a deranged former child actress torturing her crippled sister sent her career down the wrong path and she greatly damaged her overall reputation as a Hollywood great by appearing in an endless number of terrible films giving hammy performances for most of the rest of her career, though there was a small highlight every now and then. A real shame. Joan Crawford, another major film star of the same era, but who never had the acting chops of Davis gives one of her finest performances here. She is sincere, believable, touching and never goes for the rafters like Davis does here, but her role is far less flamboyant.

Although the German submarine fleet had great success during the first year of two of the war, the captain realizes that the British have adapted quite well and that things are not nearly as easy as they were before. Additionally, because he is a realist, he doesn't share the enthusiasm that some of the new sailors under his command have for the way the war is being handled either. Even so, he is still a loyal German officer and as such he steadfastly obeys whatever orders he is given--regardless of how reckless he deems some of these orders might be. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that having seen a great number of submarine movies in my time, I regard this as possibly the best film of its type due in large part to the manner in which it depicts both the stress and the tedium experienced by those who serve on these vessels.

The Submarine is ordered to venture into the waters of Gibraltar, and discover the strength of The British fleet.When I think of the greatest films from the 1980's, I can think of so many, but up there as one of the best, is Das Boot, even if you're not a great lover of war films, you will probably love it, almost fifty years on, it is still a captivating watch.I just finished watching The Director's cut, which ran for approximately three and a half hours, all I can say, is that every single minute of it had me totally entertained. I found it easier to watch it dubbed into English, but there's is no denying that this film is better in its original German language.One thing this film has in abundance, is atmosphere, you get a true sense of claustrophobic, you can almost feel the staleness of the air, and smell the dank atmosphere, it truly looks and feels realistic. Hard to imagine what life must have been like on board a submarine, crabs, mouldy bread and sweaty socks, it must have been diabolical.What I have always found so incredible about this film, is the consideration of who's side am I on, we're seeing the story from a Nazi point of view, but we get to learn that these were ordinary men, with an ordinary Captain, it really is interesting to question who you're rooting for.The camera work is incredible, it almost has a real time feel about it, all I can say is that the cameraman must have been fit.

Watching the Director's cut at 3 hours and 28 minutes was an ordeal I did over two days since I kept falling asleep. This film is far too long for no real reason and includes tons of meaningless scenes.The limited action scenes involve them diving ever deeper to escape attack only for the Allied depth charges to detonate exactly next to their hull every time no matter their depth. The chase scenes are set to a crappy Mannheim Steamroller sounding music score composed by the German jazz musician Klaus Doldinger that does not hold up at all.While the U-boat set is excellent and historically accurate, the scenes of them running on the surface unfortunately look fake as if the production crew is throwing buckets of water at them. They make no use of their deck gun throughout the film even though that was their preferred way to attack ships, saving their torpedoes for bigger targets.The best part of the film are the logistics, operation and repairs of their U-boat. So much could have been done with this film to make it so much better and still retained its historical accuracy.

",10,"Wolfgang Petersen's daunting WWII drama is an underwater chamber piece of timeless proportions. From the extravagant, mood-setting intro - where Petersen cleverly eradicates any temporal distance between us and his characters by stripping away their formality and etiquette - to the confined, mundane life aboard the U-96, and finally the opaque battles fought, Petersen shows a complete command over his story and the film medium. We get to feel and identify with every emotion, and we get to crawl under the characters' skin in a way that has rarely been done better in the war film genre. Even in the 209 minutes long Director's Cut version (upon which this review is based), Das Boot is tight and constantly to-the-point, albeit slow. But that, the slow pace of the film, is one of Petersen's greatest masterstrokes here, because it accentuates the meaninglessness and dullness of the war. And the contrasts, between the long stretches of nothingness and the short bursts of death and terror, is what really sucks you into the lives of these poor souls. Das Boot manages to convey an important distinction: These men, and others like them, were heroes, because they sacrificed their own lives for the sake of others. And yet, there was nothing heroic about the proceedings or the war itself - a point which is emphasized by the randomness of the finale. The absolutely fervent performances and a haunting theme by Klaus Dodinger crown this modern classic.",20 August 2023

",8,"In a world where reality blurs into the surreal, where the confines of normalcy yield to the intoxicating allure of the mind's darkest recesses, Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari is a cinematic gem that transcends time and genre. It beckons us to explore the labyrinthine corridors of human consciousness and emotion and stands as a striking testament to the power of visual storytelling and creativity that cinema can encompass.From the very moment the opening scene unfolds, viewers are transported into a realm of twisted reality and uncanny imagination. The jagged, contorted sets, rendered with angular precision, seem to mimic the fragmented mind of the characters, blurring the lines between the real and the unreal. The chiaroscuro lighting, a hallmark of German expressionism, contrasts that cast elongated shadows, the spectral play of light that echoes the recesses of the human psyche. The stark interplay of light and shadows with expressionism is nothing short of revelatory; it evokes emotions and thoughts unspoken, as if the very essence of the human subconscious has been captured on screen.However, what elevates Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari to a realm of cinematic excellence is its profound narrative structure. Director Robert Wiene's bold choice to shatter the conventional narrative structure heralded a new era of storytelling on celluloid. The film's disorienting narrative, where reality intertwines with the grotesque, mirrors the mind's perplexing architecture. Dr. Caligari, an enigmatic figure, ushers us into a sinister sideshow, wherein the boundaries of sanity and madness blur into a mesmerizing dance. The unreliable narrator, the unexpected twists, the subversion of reality, and after all, the revelation that leaves jaws agape and minds astir. This innovative approach laid the foundation for modern suspense and psychological thrillers, an emblematic cornerstone in the evolution of cinematic narratives. It's a crescendo that proves the power of cinema to captivate and provoke, resonating with Hitchcockian finesse and Nolan-esque complexity.In an era when cinema was still in its infancy, Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari dared to challenge conventions and shatter expectations. Its influence ripples through time, leaving traces in the works of filmmakers as diverse as Tim Burton and David Lynch. Its potency remains undiminished, reminding us that the true power of cinema lies not merely in telling stories, but in crafting experiences that resonate with the depths of human consciousness.Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari is not just a film, but an invocation to dive headlong into the uncharted seas of human consciousness, to confront our fears, desires, and fragility through the prism of cinematic genius. It's a surreal, haunting, and visually intoxicating dreamscape that continues to mesmerize, perplex, and inspire generations of cinephiles. Its legacy lives on, a luminous star that guides filmmakers to push boundaries, challenge conventions, and dare to explore the vast expanse of the human imagination.",15 August 2023

This lack of a smooth narrative arc made it difficult to connect emotionally with the characters, leaving me somewhat detached from their struggles.Additionally, the film's stylistic choices, while bold, occasionally felt forced and distracting.

",10,SPOILER ALERTCity of God is a 2002 crime and drama film directed by Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund that takes place on the outskirts of Rio. The film brings the audience into the intense life of individuals who are raised in the Brazilian slums. The beginning shows the young main characters trying to make a name for themselves through violence and theft. The other side is the character Rocket who is surrounded and affected by the crime but chooses to aspire to be a photographer and not participate in the crime life. The film has excellent camera work throughout with two examples that stick out to me. The first is the scene with the chicken chase where the chicken gets loose and is being chased throughout the streets. The handheld camera gives off an intense and realistic feel and really allows the audience to feel the chaos and energy of the event. Another example of the great camera work is the hotel robbery scenes. Camera angles were used to heighten the intensity of the events unfolding. The tracking shots were great to show what each character was doing and the low angle shots really helped show the power dynamic between the guests and the robbers. Overall I believe this film shows the unfiltered reality for some individuals who are raised in areas similar to where the film took place. The film did not hold back with any of the violence and showed how quickly someone could rise to power and how quickly they can fall.,18 October 2023
rw9383545,ur171414036,tt0317248," Sound and Symbolism in City of God
",8,"~ SPOILER ALERT!Meirelles and Lund's City of God provides viewers with an engaging, immersive experience of slum-life in Brazil's dangerous Cidade de Deus during the 1960s and 70's. The story is fueled by purposeful utilization of sound and symbolism. In the very first scene of the film, we see a gang leader tell a group of boys, their ages ranging from as young as four to older than the leader himself, to go chase and kill a runaway chicken. Even just in this first scene, skillfully-selected sound collaborates with detailed symbolism to foreshadow a story of violence, as alluded to by the sharpening of the knife; innocence being stripped away, which is shown in the chicken's naive, vain efforts to escape his enemies; and children being swept into a life that does not value human dignity, as demonstrated by powerful weapons having been placed so carelessly into the hands of youth.The story is narrated by the main character Rocket. Alexandre Rodrigues portrayed this character, and I thought he, in addition to all other cast members, did a phenomenal job. One could tell that the actors had a background of life in the slums of Rio; the story was authentic and believable, as was evidenced by the brutality seen in the shots. The storyline kept audience members on their toes and engaged, as certain aspects of the story would be left unknown until being revealed later on. For example, Lil' Dice was not revealed as the killer of the people in the motel until long after viewers saw the event occur. Lil' Dice's merciless laughter is a diegetic sound I will never forget; walking through the hallways with his gun, shooting at naked people, he truly undergoes a brutal loss of innocence.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the film and would recommend it. The only thing that was difficult to follow at points was the storyline. Sometimes, it felt disjointed, as flashbacks would occur to fill the audience in on important background relevant to the story. The main example I think of where this was a problem for me was when the story stopped abruptly to tell the history of the apartment where Lil' Ze began to operate his drug business. Although this information was necessary for viewers' understanding of the plot, I felt that this jumping disrupted the flow of the storyline.Ultimately, although brutal to watch at times, City of God is a masterpiece that utilizes sound and symbolism to tell an important story about survival, loss of innocence and the dangers of violence and desensitization of youth.",18 October 2023

The general figures that he will only lose roughly...65% of his men in the venture. As the men go to capture this hill, they find the task impossible and can't progress passed the first trench. This displeases General Mireau and he wants to charge them for cowardice.The villain can be a tad too over the top. He makes the mayor from ""Jaws"" look subtle. It weakens the theme because of how extreme he is.Unlike so many other Stanley Kubrick films, this one is very straight forward. It is a tight 88-minute runtime.

rw9503239,ur27637510,tt0050825," Kubrick's first masterpiece is arguably his best
",10,"Often labeled an anti-war film, I'd frame this film as more focused on the absurdity of war, much like Kubrick's later masterpiece, DR. STRANGELOVE. Kirk Douglas plays Col. Dax, an idealistic WWI French officer tasked with leading his troops on a suicide mission to take a fortified German ""anthill"" all so a general can get a promotion. When the mission fails, the general has three of the soldiers put on trial for cowardice, and Douglas serves as their defense attorney. Based on real-life events, PATHS OF GLORY features some of the most harrowing battle scenes ever committed to film. Unlike more sensationalistic war films, such as ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT or the films of Sam Fuller, Kubrick's cold documentarian eye captures all the horror of the battlefield, feeling both real and shocking. PATHS OF GLORY also features from of Kubrick's best use of tracking shots outside of THE SHINING, with Douglas stone-faced marching through the trenches ahead of battle (a nice contrast to when the cowardly general walks the same trenches earlier in the film). Douglas chews the scenery like the Hollywood royalty he is and shows up every actor he shares a scene with. Oddball character actor Timothy Carey (a personal favorite) is the only other actor who comes close to stealing a scene from Douglas, playing one of the soldiers on trial (Watch Carey's film he wrote, directed, and starred in, THE WORLD'S GREATEST SINNER, to see how offbeat he really could be!). Ralph Meeker has never been better playing one of the soldiers on trial. The third soldier on trial is played by Joe Turkel, best known as Lloyd in Kubrick's THE SHINING and Dr. Eldon Tyrell in BLADE RUNNER. George Macready is deliciously slimy as the ambitious general who's willing to climb the ranks even at the expense of hundreds of his men's lives. For me, what makes this film arguably Kubrick's best is that it offers a rare instance of emotion and humanity. An oft-criticism of Kubrick's films is that they are cold, calculating, and sterile, which is a fair assessment (and not necessarily a negative), but without spoiling the film's ending, which is not a typical Hollywood ending by any means, is one that won't leave a dry eye in the house (featuring the future wife of Kubrick, Christiane Kubrick, billed as Susanne Christian). PATHS OF GLORY is a tough, emotionally raw, searing indictment on the absurdity of war that is essential viewing for cinephiles. FUN FACT! Douglas had it written into his contract for this film that there would be one scene where he is shirtless.",19 December 2023
rw9490464,ur53053227,tt0050825," A short and objective film, with a clear and still relevant message, as well as a huge performance by Kirk Douglas.
",9,"There are several films about World War I, but it is far from being seen by the public as one of the best. In fact, it seems to me a little forgotten today. It is, however, timely and current in its pacifist message in which the greatest absurdity of war is emphasized in a partially true story, in which a group of three French soldiers is shot by cowardice after joining an inglorious attack to a much stronger and prepared German position.Stanley Kubrick is a director to which no one gets indifferent: either if he loves or hates. He seems to have enjoyed fostering this by choosing hard themes, uncomfortable and debatable movies. This is just one more, and I, who loved some of his movies just as I hated others, decided to put this movie in the middle of the table. It is much more direct and easy to understand than most of his later work, but is nonetheless uncomfortable for the questions raised. For example, the contrasts between the ordinary soldier, mud in a trench and subject to die like an animal, and the generals, kilometers in the rear, in beautiful palaces where there is not a single shot. Intelligently, Kubrick focuses on the obvious injustice of punishment as proof of the inhuman absurdity of war and military leaders.Thus, the movie is simple, direct, short (not even one and a half hours) and abrasive. Black-and-white cinematography is very clear, luminous and works a lot of light and shadow. The edition is effective and the soundtrack almost imperceptible for discretion. The sets and costumes are worthy of a large production. However, there are no action and combat scenes do not focus on the intensity of the fight, but its most human side. It is another perspective of war: those looking for action will not have what they want, but who wants a deeper movie has a full plate here.Kirk Douglas is the protagonist, embodying a colonel who is responsible for carrying out the defense of the military under trial. The efforts he desperately leads to the last instances are notable, but as the sentence was predetermined, the court is a sordid masquerade. Douglas begins to be cordial and contained, an officer at the orders, part of the gear, but gradually changes as his character is confronted with all that brutality, and this is really a meritorious effort for any actor. I don't know his work well yet, but I wouldn't surprise me if this was one of Douglas's best movies. Unfortunately, and without disregard for Adolphe Menjou and Joe Turkel's efforts, the rest of the cast does not accompany him at all.",12 December 2023

Frankly, it's little better than a suicide one, but his operational commander ""Gen. Mireau"" (George Macready) is determined at all costs that they succeed. Let battle commence! Only the French soldiers quickly realise that they are facing a well armed, immovable, German opponent and are either killed or driven back. Desperate to motivate his men, ""Mireau"" gives an order that is luckily not acted upon and with the mission deemed a failure and many of the men now in the relative safety of their trenches, the general orders a court martial for cowardice of three of the survivors. ""Dax"" is appalled but a trial there must be... Are the right people being tried and is the outcome a mere formality? I saw a 16mm print of this rather gripping and depressing wartime drama and it augmented the genuine sense of peril faced by these men as incoming artillery, the claustrophobic trench existences and - make no mistake - the competencies of their officers are put on display for us. It's dark, wet, gritty and as we reach the denouement clearly illustrative of the futility of much of this stage of this war. Kirk Douglas takes top billing and is adequate, it's Macready who actually steals this for me and the director's wife does the briefest of scenes as a German cabaret singer, too. Again, I think cinema will focus this better than television, but either way it's a thought-provoking exposé of war that holds up well 60-odd years later.",23 November 2023
rw9365645,ur33162918,tt0050825," In his first masterpiece, Kubrick constructs as a reflective film about war, far from the glorification of heroic deeds, showing his reflection on human nature
",8,"The story is based on a 1935 novel of the same name (Paths of Glory), written by Humphrey Cobb, which, in turn, is inspired by real events, however terrifying they may be. ""Paths of Glory"" addresses the First World War, a conflict little explored by Hollywood (possibly due to the limited participation of the United States in it, unlike the Second), specifically due to the attempt by the French army to take over a German defense point, known as like Anthill, as it is on top of a hill, considered impregnable. The troops led by Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) are unable to advance much beyond the trenches and the attack fails, with many soldiers refusing to continue towards certain death. Oblivious to the evident impossibility of the attack's success, three soldiers are taken to court martial and Colonel Dax, aware of how the unsuccessful attack occurred as he was present on the battlefield, decided to defend the soldiers before the court's judgment.Dissatisfied with the order, Dax and his men go on the mission and fail miserably as expected. With no chance of making progress and seeing the fall of their comrades who tried to return to the trenches, many of the soldiers did not even go to the battlefield, and it is at this point that the plot divides. In this first part, we feel the terror of war in the wonderful sequence in which the colonel leads his men trying to reach Anthill. However, with the defeat, the troops suffer from the arbitrary decisions of General Mireau (George Macready) and three men are taken to the French court martial, accused of cowardice. From that point on, ""Glória Made of Blood"" changes tone. The political obstacle to decisions and the court supported by an absurd accusation are reflections of the power game that permeates the film from the opening scene. Three soldiers are chosen at random to bear the disastrous choice that General Mireau chose to make in search of yet another decoration, serving as scapegoats to show that the French army has everything under control and create a psychological game of submission with the survivors. Meanwhile, Colonel Dax (who was a criminal lawyer before the war) and his idealism against injustice, lose the battle before those who had already decided the fate of the soldiers even before the court was opened.The discussion between idealization and practicality is one of the film's main thematic concerns. Although it does not state categorically, the conclusion that the work reaches are that a situation as complex and, incredible as it may seem, bureaucratic as war has no room for ideals of conduct. A moment that works as an analogy for this ""thesis"" is the brilliant final scene where the martial beats that permeate the entire film give way to the sweet singing of the character played by Susanne Christiane Kubrick (she would later become the director's wife), a German whose voice moves countless French soldiers, only for moments later they have to return to their duties and the war drums return in full force. In other words, the peace idealized by so many people is momentary and quickly obliterated by the need to continue the fight.Another concern of the film is that in the end it is always the person with the least power who pays the price for the decisions made by their superiors. This gap between positions is very well illustrated by the production design: while General Mireau's room and the room where the trial takes place are sumptuous and spacious environments (here, the sound team does an excellent job of echoing throughout the entire room). Space for the characters' speeches), the ""barracks"" improvised by Dax and the prison in which the soldiers are thrown are extremely poor and even dirty. A moment that also displays this disparity is the sequence of images that show General Mireau asking to shoot at the army itself from the safe base in which he is located, the officer refusing the request sitting in a chair with just his fingers in his ear so that the The noise of explosions doesn't make it impossible for you to hear what the general says and the soldiers fighting and dying on the battlefield.Stanley Kubrick (""A Clockwork Orange"") is punctual in creating parallels that explain the relationships of power and oppression towards the victimized characters. From the lighting of the palace and the parties, the absence of light in the prison and soldiers' quarters, the camera angles in the courtroom showing the breadth of those who accuse, as well as the oppressive lens that flattens the perspective of the accused. The film is full of the filmmaker's characteristic details, which would become trademarks of his future filmography. Another construction that determines the morality carried in the work is that of the character of Kirk Douglas, a colonel who seeks to maintain his principles in the face of the abuse of power he suffers and witnesses, in addition to the sharp dialogues with anti-war speeches and total opposition to the patriotism inflamed by wars. Through the protagonist's challenging nature, we are left with a spark of hope in the face of a hierarchy where the deaths of soldiers are nothing more than numbers in search of merits distorted by greed.Courageous, Colonel Dax is also an intellectual man and aware of the role he plays. The moment in which he quotes a pejorative phrase from Samuel Johnson about patriotism not only illustrates the level of his reading but also shows that, regardless of agreeing with the English philosopher's opinion, he still willingly accepts the mission assigned to him, which shows both his character and the process of self-awareness he went through to understand the importance of his presence and his decisions within the conflict. Furthermore, when the situation gets out of control, he is willing to defend the soldiers in court, even if it costs him his career, all in the name of ethics and the ideals he defends.Still talking about Stanley Kubrick's work, if the director has the same technical rigor shown in ""The Killing"" in the long dialogues, it is in the scenes of the initial recognition of the location occupied by enemy troops and the only battle present in the film that the filmmaker, alongside George Krause, the director of photography, are truly brilliant. In the first, apprehension is created exuberantly by the dark photography and the close-ups portraying the fear felt by the characters. There is also the help of the subjective plane that keeps the figure of one of the soldiers who had walked into hostile territory at a distance, which means that the audience does not fully see what is happening; in the second, in turn, the traveling and zooming in and out are essential to create the sensation of panic in the viewer and throw them into the chaos and violence of war. Furthermore, the visual resources used by Kubrick to show the immensity of the trenches generate imitators to this day. Just watch the already iconic scene of the horse escaping in Steven Spielberg's ""War Horse"", to realize the perpetuity of the moment created by Kubrick.In this sense, ""Paths of Glory"" is constructed as a reflective film about war, far from the glorification of heroic deeds, already with Kubrick, even though it is one of his first films, showing his reflection on human nature. The film narrates the brutality of war, the coldness of the interests of those who command the war but do not fight it and the melancholy ending about how humanity can move between extremes. Amid nobly effortful and elegant attempts to establish a coherent atmosphere both to the war conflict and to political moments parallel to it, inviting more and more questioning spectators to reflect, ""Glória Made of Blood"", therefore, is an unforgettable piece of art of the highest level, capable of involving people in such (in)human and universal conflicts of conscience, making us feel identified with the physical and psychological tension that common soldiers and war veterans experienced in their lives, between their trenches and their palaces, constantly having their codes and the future of their nations put to the test. Without any blatant jingoism distributed as in a Steven Spielberg or Clint Eastwood film, the impact of the pictorial here does not give way to the help of saturated colors that attract today's audiences, something that is absolutely not needed here.See the famous scene (as beautiful as the spy crawl of three soldiers in enemy territory before the first bombardment, thanks to the excellent composition of monochromatic images in full screen) by Kirk Douglas, in an extensive and fluid traveling shot, in the trenches infested with frightened soldiers among a polyphony of explosions and agony almost visible, if not seen on the faces of compatriots subjected to a war whistle, and then, to collective death. With ""Paths of Glory"", Kubrick comes up with his first masterpiece. In addition to demonstrating an admirable technical mastery, which ranges from the use of traveling in the trenches following the soldiers' emotional exhaustion to the immersive framing that would become his trademark, the director did not dispense with a good dose of acidity, pessimism and an extremely bittersweet ending - befitting with the false illusion of victory that only war and its consequences are capable of providing.",8 October 2023

A clearly pointed out several times suicide mission, but nonetheless believed to be a turning point in winning the war for France. Despite objection, the Generals pressure Dax to carry out their orders, and he reluctantly accepts knowing full well himself that its a lost cause. That this was based on a true story is something in itself! WOW!That Kubrick developed the set up and framing and positioning of his shots so meticulously throughout this movie so young in life and his career is a testimony to his raw, natural talent. The atmosphere and uneasy tension he became known for is here on full display. The scene with the reconnaissance team, for example. Colonel Dax's walk through the troops, especially in black & and white, is all world foreshadowing of what's to come. His obsession with mentally deranged characters with no remorse and his awesome use of music to build suspense, its all here.

",8,"Dear, departed Barry Norman reckoned this Kubrick anti-war film the equal, or superior, to the later Dr Strangelove and Full Metal Jacket. What strikes most immediately when viewing the film, if you're British, is its resemblance to Blackadder Goes Forth. The relationship between General Melchett, Darling and Blackadder is obviously inspired/lifted from that of the general, colonel and major at the start of Kubrick's film. In place of Blackadder's levity Kubrick gives us dread. Dread expectation.What's fascinating, or do I mean repugnant, is that WW1 was not simply a matter of different nations hating one another and leaping into the pit of hell out of some ancient, irrational bloodlust, but as Paths of Glory makes clear, there is class hatred there too, officer class hatred of the common ""scum"" soldier. The top brass are only too happy to allow the slaughter of the lowest ranks, the pawns on the board. The failed attack on an impregnable German fortification has to be paid for with a blood sacrifice, and those few most responsible are also the hardest to bring down. They are the enemy within.I couldn't help feeling that the film would carry greater insouciance if it were actually in French rather than English. But how much more could one cope with? The initial scene in which Generals Broulard and Mireau discuss an attack has an awkward rhythm to it, as does Mireau's inspection of a trench. Maybe this was intentional, i don't know. The final scene in the tavern I found to be too heavy-handed. The fact that we don't find out what happened to Mireau (suicide?) was also a disappointment.A very powerful indictment of senseless war and military hierarchical inhumanity.

Also, the movie has a romantic comedy element in the movie, and I thought it worked well with the horror comedy vibe of the movie, with it also being funny on how it plays out.The main character Shaun played by Simon Pegg was great as this character; I liked how his life is standard and boring along with him having issues with his girlfriend and friends, until this zombie outbreak occurs where he must go save his girlfriend and friends with his best friend Ed, and Simon Pegg was very funny in the movie landing a lot of jokes and some physical humor at times. Shaun's best friend Ed played by Nick Frost was also great in the movie; he is someone who has been living with Shaun for a long time and likes hanging out with him at a place called the Winchester Pub, until he goes with Shaun to save his girlfriend and friends and he was also very funny in the movie, doing a lot of humor involving certain jokes in the movie and how he acts to everyone or certain things around him.The whole zombie outbreak was well done with it being subtle as it starts, but as the movie goes along, it increasingly becomes the focus as the movie goes on; the look of the zombies is simple, but they have well done make up and effects to them where it looks cool. The comedy in the movie is very funny, and the actors do an excellent job during a lot of funny moments that happen in the movie, along with them doing certain stunts and quick action scenes that were also well done.

Simon Pegg has some acting that would be considered for an Oscar reel if it weren't in a movie that the Academy sticks their noses up to. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have great chemistry together, I completely believe them as best friends. The fact that this movie is so genuine, is what makes all the other aspects work.Other times it can be action packed and suspenseful. The fact that these characters are not skilled in survival skills does make things funny. But it also makes the action moments more thrilling. These characters are not invincible. The feel human, they feel vulnerable. Any minute of this film they might get killed just from the fact that they have no idea what they're doing.And of course, this movie can be hilarious. The zombie movie genre is ripe for satire and this movie executes things in a very clever way. The writing of Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg is very witty. The editing by Chris Dickens needs to be highlighted as well, he makes a lot of these jokes work, and makes sure the movie has no extra fat.There are some characters that do not work in this film. Likewise, there are some moments of character drama that feel a bit forced. Sometimes the incompetence of the characters is more frustrating than it is endearing.But outside of those problems, I highly recommend this film. It has a little bit for everyone.

I was happy to see David suffer the worst slaughtering of the movie in which he is literally torn limb from limb.This movie also incorporates the gunshot angle first seen in the 2003 remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in which you see through the hole from the backside of the victim. The comedy is very well played; it doesn't go overboard nor does it lessen the impact of the horror and gore.Another unique thing about Shaun of the Dead is how the soundtrack is side-splittingly integrated into the action sequences.If for some reason you haven't seen Shaun of the Dead; see it now!

The zombies also are a mere inconvenience to them, similar to their dead end jobs, uptight flatmates, or cleaning up their flat.A lot of Wright-esque edits - such as quick cuts, montages etc - which will be used throughout the trilogy.Some ironic and smart story dynamics too - e.g. Shaun had never introduced his girlfriend of three years to his mother, and it took the end of the world to happen for him to actually do it.Some of the best shots are the ones showing how akin the behaviour of people in our society is to that of so called brain-dead zombies.Entertaining overall - third act slows a bit - not filled with fall on the floor humour - but is well written - worth a watch if you want to see the whole trilogy.",5 August 2023

",5,"I recently watched the movie ""Shaun of the Dead"" and I have to say, it was a bit of a mixed bag for me. On one hand, I appreciated the unique blend of comedy and horror that the film attempted to achieve. The idea of a zombie apocalypse being the backdrop for a comedy was definitely intriguing and had a lot of potential.The film had its moments of genuine humor, with some well-executed jokes and witty dialogue. The chemistry between the main characters, played by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, was undeniably entertaining and their comedic timing was spot on. I found myself laughing out loud at certain scenes and genuinely enjoying the humor that was presented.However, there were also some aspects of the movie that fell flat for me. While the comedy was certainly present, I felt that the horror elements were lacking. The zombies themselves were not particularly scary or threatening, and the film didn't really build up any tension or suspense. It seemed to rely more on the comedy aspect rather than delivering on the horror front.Additionally, I found the plot to be a bit predictable and formulaic. It followed the typical zombie movie tropes and didn't really offer anything new or innovative. The characters were also somewhat one-dimensional, with little development or depth. I didn't feel particularly invested in their journey or their outcome.The pacing of the film was also a bit off. There were moments where the story seemed to drag and lose momentum, and then suddenly pick up again. This uneven pacing made it difficult for me to fully engage with the film and stay invested in the story.Overall, I would give ""Shaun of the Dead"" a rating of 5 out of 10. While it had its moments of humor and entertainment, it fell short in terms of delivering a truly compelling and well-rounded film. It had potential, but ultimately failed to fully capitalize on it. If you're a fan of zombie comedies, it might be worth a watch, but don't expect anything groundbreaking.",3 August 2023

But I just never had the urge to sit down and watch a movie from 1922, before now in 2023.And while ""Nosferatu"" is based on the Bram Stoker story of ""Dracula"", I must admit that the movie's rewritten storyline from Henrik Galeen was adequate, for sure, but it wasn't a masterpiece. I, personally, don't feel that I have been missing out on a great cinematic masterpiece here, by not actually having seen ""Nosferatu"" before now in 2023.

A 2023 major franchise movie with an enormous budget versus a 1922 silent black-and-white classic adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula.For me personally, the key takeaway from Nosferatu is the reminder that the story and the storytelling are paramount, and that you can tell pretty much any story on a shoestring, with thoughtful ingenuity compensating for your lack of resources. You don't have to show the audience every little thing. In fact, sometimes it's more powerful not to.The performance of the actors is, in my opinion, the most important tool for the director's telling of any given story, and acting in silent films naturally differs from acting in talkies - much the same way theatre acting differs from film acting. Watching Nosferatu today, more than a hundred years after it was made, the acting style feels a bit dated, but there is, of course, a very good reason for that. The actors get the job done, and I happily praise their performances.As you can see in my bio, I rate all films based solely on my impression when I watch them, without adjusting for when they were made, and without crediting their impact on, and contribution to, cinema overall.

Brief Review -Rewatch makes it better. A stupendous and groundbreaking achievement in the monster genre that even surpasses Hoyt's astonishing ""The Lost World"" (1925). I saw Peter Jackson's King Kong (2005) a decade ago and couldn't stop crying after the film. Then I learned about the earlier version of the story, which took me to this 1933 flick. I was stunned! Now, revisiting this monstrous classic after watching over 5000 films doesn't change the fact that it was a groundbreaking film for all times. Rather, this re-watch made it better for me because it came after I saw Harry O. Hoyt's prodigious cult, ""The Lost World."" I just can't believe they achieved such effects almost a century ago. The Lost World, or even the 1933 King Kong, may look like a toy story cartoon in black and white today, but just imagine watching these films in the 1920s and 1930s. Even the idea of imagining this leaves chills in my spine. I can't imagine how the audience would have reacted to those scenes. Kong takes 45 minutes of runtime to make his first appearance, and after he enters the picture, he takes it to a whole new monstrous level. It's ENORMOUS, GIGANTIC and UNIMAGINABLE! One could have only dreamt about it, but they made that Kong vs Godzilla (type of) fight scene in 1933. How!!? Above all, they had an intellectual ending too. ""It wasn't the airplanes. It was beauty that killed the beast."" Disney should have sent them a copyright strike, not because they used the title but for being too intelligent and metaphorical about it. I mean, who would have thought about ending the film with such a powerful dialogue? Insane. The Empire Tower and Train scene was just crazy. Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B.

They invented several new camera techniques to capture the different images that are being displayed on screen, stop motion being blended with real people was a huge milestone and as for the close up shots of Kong's face, foot or arm they built huge models of them so that they could capture Kong interacting with people in a close proximity.I cannot list everything that this film achieved but it was one of the most important films ever produced, look no further than the fact it inspired countless people to pursue film careers, the most notable being Peter Jackson who later remake the film and even recreated the lost bug pit sequence in stop motion.The score is stellar and the visuals are phenomenal for the time and it's still outstanding to watch to this day.",6 November 2023

No talent agent would get him an actress due to his reputation of filming dangerous movies. Plus, he wanted to take the actress on a boat for weeks with nothing but men. That wouldn't be appealing to any lady.Carl found the actress he needed in Ann Darrow (Fay Wray), a woman he saw trying to steal an apple. She was desperate and she was pretty which made her perfect.Carl was always elusive with his destination and with what he was looking for. Even the captain of the ship, Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot), didn't know exactly where they were headed.

Then they found out real fast what Kong was and what lay behind the large gate separating the people from the rest of the jungle.I watched ""King Kong"" with a real critical eye. I wanted to see if ""King Kong"" was worth the accolades it gets or if people bought into some hype.It deserves the accolades.It's not a great movie, but it is a fantastic production. Unlike other action adventure movies of that time, this really was an action adventure. When I think of other ""action adventures"" at that time they pale in comparison to ""King Kong."" Even the special effects were novel. The stop motion effects used to depict Kong and other creatures would be a style used well into the 80's.

",5,"""King Kong"" is one of those films which are frequently spoken of as Great Classics of the Cinema but which I have always found difficult to take seriously. This may be due to my having grown up with ""Kitten Kong"", that parody by the seventies comedy team, The Goodies, in which a gigantic kitten climbs up an iconic London skyscraper, the Post Office Tower. So if a giant cat climbing up the the Post Office Tower is something ludicrous, why are we supposed to treat seriously the idea of a giant monkey climbing up an iconic New York skyscraper, the Empire State Building?The story is about Carl Denham, an American filmmaker, and his crew who are trying to shoot an adventure movie on a remote tropical island. (The co-ordinates given enable us to locate it in the Indian Ocean, somewhere west of Sumatra; it has become known as ""Skull Island"", but this name is never used in the film itself). The island is home to a population of dinosaurs which have somehow survived into modern times despite having died out everywhere else millions of years ago, but for our purposes, its most important denizen is a gigantic gorilla named Kong, who is worshipped by the local human population as a god. These people kidnap Ann Darrow, Denham's beautiful leading lady, and offer her as a sacrifice to Kong, who seizes her and makes off with her into the jungle. After a number of adventures with the dinosaurs, Ann's sailor boyfriend Jack manages to rescue her. Denham succeeds in capturing Kong and ships him back to New York, hoping to make a fortune by exhibiting him as the ""eighth wonder of the world"". Once there, however, Kong escapes and seizes Ann again, setting up the famous ending on the Empire State Building. (In 1933 this was a very new addition to the New York skyline, having been completed only two years previously).I haven't seen either of the remakes from 1976 and 2005 so cannot make comparisons, but have to admit that I cannot see what is so great about the original or why it so often ends up on lists of ""the greatest films of all time"". Its best feature is probably the action scenes involving Kong and the various dinosaurs. These scenes used a pioneering stop-motion animation technique invented by Willis O'Brien which would later be taken up by his protege Ray Harryhausen. Although this technique looks crude today, even by comparison with Harryhausen's films, we have to remember that in 1933 it was very state-of-the-art.There is, however, a lot that I disliked about the film, particularly that it is often offensively racist. I am not just talking about the patronising treatment of the Chinese ship's cook, or even the depiction of the natives of Skull Island as primitive savages. (Oddly enough, the version which I recently saw was not prefaced by that now familiar disclaimer about ""this film contains outdated racial depictions which may cause offence to modern viewers""). I mean that the whole concept behind the film can be seen as an allegory of the white racist's fear of the black man. In the 1930s white racists frequently compared black people to apes and expressed a belief that all black men have an obsessive sexual desire for white women. (Such beliefs have not completely gone away even today, although they are less often voiced in polite company than they were then). Given that the film is about an ape who obsessively desires a beautiful, blonde white woman, the racial subtext seems clear.The film's view of women also seems a patronising one. Fay Wray as the heroine is the helpless little woman who has to be rescued by the strong, handsome Jack and spends most of the film screaming. When women aren't helpless little screamers they are temptresses whose beauty weakens and emasculates the male sex. The film starts with a supposed ""old Arabian proverb"", ""And lo, the beast looked upon the face of beauty. And it stayed its hand from killing. And from that day, it was as one dead,"" and this theme is taken up in the closing line, ""It was beauty killed the beast"".Trying to evaluate the film ninety years after it was made is a difficult task, although we should bear in mind that even then some critics found the plot ridiculous. Yes, it was technically groundbreaking when it first came out, but then so was ""The Birth of a Nation"". ""King Kong"" is not as openly racist as Griffith's film, but racism is still there even though it is cloaked in metaphor. Those technical advances should not persuade us to overlook some very dubious racial attitudes. 5/10.",21 June 2023

The picture still holds up well after more than ninety years , adding moody Max Steiner musical score and color enough . Spectacular and emotive scenes, including one where Kong strips Wray. Problems lingered on the set and at a high cost, it was one of the most expensive movie of its era and took time to finish . Scenes were cut during the 1938 re-release because of the Hays production code , including one where a curious Kong strips Wray of her clothes.This known and classic film ""King Kong"" (1933) was competently made by Ernerst B Schoedsack and Merian C Cooper . Followed by ""Son of Kong"" , Ernest's enthusiasm for this movie was curtailed when he was told he had less than half the budget of ""King Kong"" (1933) to work with. The poor box office of ""Son of Kong"" convinced RKO to lay off giant ape movies until ""Mighty Joe Young"" (1949). From 1926, Schoedsack worked in tandem with an old army acquaintance, Captain Merian C. Cooper, under contract to Paramount on the documentary dramas ""Grass"" (1925) and ""Chang"" (1927), shot respectively in Persia (Iran) and in Siam (Thailand) . After going solo on another documentary, ""Rango"" (1931), filmed in Sumatra, Schoedsack was hired by RKO from 1932 to 1935 to direct documentaries, starting with The most dangerous game (1932). He then worked (uncredited) with Cooper on ""King Kong"" (1933), and later directed the (unofficial) sequel ""Mighty Joe Young"" (1949) with the same production team. Schoedsack's sparse output as a director also includes the classic live action/miniature science-fiction drama ""Dr Cyclops"" (1940).Being subsequently remade numerous times with various theme derivations. Hoping to capitalize the ""King Kong"" hit (1933), director Ernest B Schoedsack quickly threw ¨Son of Kong¨(1933) with Robert Armstrong , Helen Mack , Frank Reiche , Victor Wong. And after that , ¨King Kong¨ (1976) by John Guillermin with Jeff Bridges , Jessica Lange, John Randolph , Ed Lauter , Corbin Bersen, John Lone .

",10,"When I was young, this film was more of a beautiful spectacle of animation rather than a interesting plot. The art to this film is beyond any doubt one of the best in animation history. This alone could make me rate this a 10/10 film, many could argue movies like your name or suzume could surpass the art. Hayoa miyazi prides himself in hand drawn animation, as seen in most of his films, and this to me brings this movie up a lot.Beauty of art aside, the plot to this film is insane. Though the only negative I would have is how slow the beginning is, putting a lot of people off. A plot where the character is neither in the ""good"" or ""bad"" and rather helps everyone and is then seen of a bad guy from both sides. The good and bad side is completely the choice of the viewer (though most would be on princess mononokes side).The antagonist to this film is arguably the most ambiguous character in the film. Is she really evil for the pain she has put on the land, or is she a good person for the service and valour she has given to her own kind?Hayao miyazi also produces well thought out, powerful female characters with faults and development that many films these days lack.There is so much to unpack in this film its ridiculous.I would generally call this film one of the best.

In a way it's a simple story, a feudal magical plot where traditional Japanese folklore and spirituality clashes with the realities of being human. However the attention to detail, the way each important character is portrayed as main, with little to no judgement, letting the viewer decide who is what and which decision or path in life is better, that is what makes this film great.The plot goes like this: a prince from the East defends his village against a monstrous demon, thus getting cursed with something that rots him from inside out and eventually will kill him. The young man must journey to the West to determine the cause of the curse, the source of the mysterious iron ball that killed a god and perhaps find a cure for his curse. But upon reaching his destination, he gets embroiled into tribal conflict between multiple factions, human and spirits. Maintaining neutrality will take strength, or maybe weakness. The movie is such that you are free to choose any option. There are no villains and no heroes, just characters set on their path by their own beliefs and narratives.If there is something that I did not like is the name. The main character is not Princess Mononoke. In fact there is no indication of why she is a princess and for what and most of the time she is just a love interest and a secondary character. The lead role falls upon prince Ashitaka. Why was this not called Prince Ashitaka, then? Don't know. Also there is something to be said of people always killing minor characters and letting the major ones live or do whatever. A trope that I personally don't like.Bottom line: I was blown away by this when I watched it 20 years ago.

Cinema is a different view of the manifestation of Allah as the Lord today. Sometimes it is wisdom, sometimes it is an example, sometimes it can reflect different points of view that arouse hatred, can strongly influence a person in a negative or positive direction. In fact, for the eye that knows how to see, the events that Allah has made obvious from the past (from the past and from the eternal) in this world are really a good opportunity to get to know and know Allah. It is arifin's job to be able to see a wisdom in every movie. In fact, even if it seems unnecessary, many lessons can be learned from all kinds of movies and novels. Cinema, like a book, reads its own life story to a person, a person watching himself in the mirror on the white screen feels as if he is laughing or crying at someone else. In every era, man has enjoyed different movies according to the science of creation and the era. Cinema can easily convey a person to his own truth, mistakes and truths. It is the eye that makes the beauty of the rose obvious and is able to see the rose. How happy is he who can reach the level of understanding the spiritual meanings in movies. In the light of these windows, a star that comes sliding out of the sky is "" The Fire in Me "".! There is no other word to say about the story because it contains quite a lot of surprises, but no matter what meaning you attach to the cinema, this is such a powerful film that you cannot remain indifferent. Villeneuve not only created very realistic and impressive sets and captured them on camera. By deploying his audience like Marwan's twins and replacing each answered question with a bigger one, he also managed to provide a curious viewing that goes up and up until the finale. An example of pure cinema with a powerful script that worries about the mixing of feelings of hate and love and feeding the other, and does not waste a single moment of its 130-minute duration... ""The Fire in Me"", which has a modest budget, is an incredible film that uses the visualizing effects of cinema to the fullest! He has a convincing and detailed visual work in all the sequences, such as panzers and tanks going to the conflict, houses being burned, Militiamen shooting a bus full of people, Marwan pretending to be his mother to save a little girl. When watching the movie that came out of Canada and shook the audience by both sides, it is impossible not to question the six empty words ""Turkish cinema has improved a lot in recent years, dear"". Immediately after watching The Fire in Me, these films I mentioned are perceived as talentless pictures drawn by a kindergarten student to benefit his teacher. And the Fire in Me is actually a biased movie, no matter how much it seems that the side is not like that.

Dec. But this is a state of taking sides, explained by the ability of human nature, without caricaturing the events and the living, and filled with regrets at every moment... It's as if the director wanted to disrupt the traditional understanding that the bill for everything is issued to Muslims.

We almost immediately see a young man shot dead in a ruthlessly-conducted honour killing and later witness a busload of passengers fleeing a warzone during the Lebanese Civil War gunned down in cold blood. A scant few survive the attack but are then burned alive in the bus by their assailants and even a young child running back to her mother on the bus is shot down in cold blood. But as we much later see at the scarcely believable gut-wrenching climax, horror takes many forms and here an unimaginable truth has the impact of any number of violent scenes in this or almost any other film you care to mention.The only thing for me however, was whether the reveal was credible. You'd have to go all the way back to Oedipus's tale in the legends of Greek mythology for comparison and I must I struggled to accept it as believable.What isn't in doubt is the power of the story-telling here. Shot with a washed-out colour palette in realistic documentary fashion, we follow two interweaving timelines which inevitably converge for the conclusion. The first concerns the depicted-as-present-day Canada somewhere in the late 1990s when an elderly woman of Middle-Eastern extraction dies suddenly. She has a twin son and daughter of adult age and has left them through her solicitor and employer of 18 years, a letter each, which seem to pose separate indecipherable riddles as regards their birthrights.It sets the daughter on a trip to her mother's homeland to uncover the truth with her initially reluctant brother only joining her much later on in the process. What the daughter learns about her mother's amazing life and what she went through will shock her to the core, while never diminishing her love and admiration for her.The second narrative takes us back to the mother's own remarkable story. Trying to escape the Civil War, she witnesses unspeakable horrors before being forced to act as an assassin of a senior political figure to whom she'd been assigned as a language teacher to the family's child.

Impressed as I was by the recreation of life during wartime and the performances of the ensemble cast especially Lubne Azabal as the mother, for me the resolution as well as the coincidence leading to it, were both just too fantastical to swallow and subverted all that had gone before to make the story seem real.While I got the big messages put out there about the horrors of war, a mother's love and ultimately the power of forgiveness, it for me was a shame that the sensationalist ending failed much of what had gone before.",5 September 2023

",8,"Why is Denis Villeneuve my favourite working director? That third act is the only answer you will need.That bone-chilling moment that happens, is what storytelling is all about. Denis, in his later work, has proven that he is a master at meticulously building up the tension and the atmosphere around his characters and their conflict. Here, you begin to see the seeds of how you cannot help but give your full attention to the imagery at hand.Incendies is a tragedy, it is not a story that you can easily wrap your head around. At times, you may feel confused at where it is all heading, what the film is trying to say, or what is going to happen. Much like the characters themselves, you are slowly putting together the narrative, and when it explodes, it explodes.While it might not go into extreme detail about the settings of the war the story takes place in, it chooses to focus on how war and conflict can create the unimaginable, and how it continues to live with generations. The imagery is extremely powerful, the performances, especially the lead, are all captivating, but what honestly hurts the film a bit is the screenplay, especially the segments in Arabic.It's obvious that Denis worked here with a lot of non-actors for authenticity or that the hired actors were not native Arabic speakers, and it shows. It can get really rough when it keeps on switching between the different dialects, and the different locations, when it's supposed to be one area, I couldn't help but notice it way too often. Because of this, there becomes an obvious imbalance in terms of quality between the segments in Arabic and those in French, which can be frustrating. This brought down my overall experience and rating by a bit, I just can't help it when something like this takes me out of the experience.Nevertheless, Incendies is a haunting, thrilling, and disturbing mystery that is elevated by Villeneuve's direction, and while it's not his strongest work, it's undeniably a powerful assortment of visuals that depict a unique aspect of the atrocities of war.Denis never misses.",3 September 2023

A very clever movie that does social commentary on racism, cultural appropriation, slavery and repressed trauma. The cinematography is excellent. It's chock full of metaphors, symbolism and foreshadowing. The acting is off the charts from everyone. Daniel Kaluyya's performance as Chris is truly a special one. It's almost like he's not even acting, it's more like he's living the part. He's got very expressive eyes and it really elevates his acting. It's interesting to see him actively try to figure out what's going on. You can see it in his eyes how suspicious he is about everything. That sense of horror and dread by Chris towards the end of the movie was a feeling very well captured, one can easily resonate with it.Peele's way of subverting expectations is what makes his projects feel so unique and different. It's brilliant how throughout the movie they keep giving subtle cues to make us think the story is going in a certain direction only for the rug to be pulled from under our feet and it just completely flip out of nowhere. The layers in this movie are very well thought out. The best part is peeling them back and trying to figure out what the hell is actually going on.It's a creepy, unsettling and at times funny movie that will make you think. It's the art of storytelling that makes this such a stand out and memorable movie. I'll always admire how creative Peele's ideas are and how he can bring those ideas to life in unique ways.

",7,"The final instatement of the original Star Wars trilogy. The Return of the Jedi begins with a return to Tatooine where our group of heroes must rescue Han Solo from the Gangster Jabba the Hut. This first act is exciting, creative and holds your attention. The pivot of the plot in Return of the Jedi is that the Empire is close to completing a second death star which if finished would spell doom for the rebels. Since the second film Luke's powers and confidence have grown considerably however he now is put into a position of emotional conflict, he knows he must help to destroy the empire, but his father is part of that empire.Return of the Jedi is generally considered to be the weakest of the three films, though not by all. One example would be the character of Han Solo, after Han is rescued from carbonate his character has little else to do, yes he gets involved in the action like the other two films, but absent are any internal conflict. In A New Hope he struggled to put aside his selfishness and become part of something bigger. The Empire Strikes Back also has Han in emotional conflict over his feelings towards Leia and his desire to leave so he can pay off Jabba. The tone is slightly mixed up at points in Return of the Jedi, A New Hope was fun and exciting, The Empire Strikes Back was tense and dark. Return of the Jedi seemed to end up being a mix of the two, sometimes cutting between scenes of Wicket doing cute stuff and atmospheric tense scenes between Luke, Vader and the Emperor. The inclusion of the Ewoks has been controversial, some people feeling Lucas was starting to pander too much towards kids and merchandising, something he'd be accused of again 15 years later when he was making the Phantom Menace.",26 December 2023

",8,"Now, in late 2023, I look at this film through different eyes. I mostly ignore the (merchandise-friendly) Ewoks; I focus on Luke's development and the pleasure of seeing Carrie Fisher in her prime (and yes, THAT bikini). Luke knows enough to be dangerous and even reckless, but he manages quite a mental balancing act given the mind games of the Emperor. The Luke we eventually see (in the final trilogy) is far more knowledgeable and powerful, but bears the scars of his failures as well, which gives him a tragically wise gravitas. Here, in Episode VI, Luke is in a transitional phase between gee-whiz wonderment and future Force guru.Personally, I find it interesting that the Jedi use trickery to minimize violence, and that they are looked down upon for this (e.g., the ""old Jedi mind trick"" as Jabba calls it). By contrast, the Empire simply relies on overwhelming firepower. The Emperor is the centroid of a deterministic (and ruthless) view of nature; whereas the Jedi are more enlightened, believing in free will and the power of a noble individual to overcome great adversity. Note how Luke emphasizes CHOICE when dealing with Jabba and his minions.{FYI, Free Will is essentially accountability; one can't believe in both a Heaven/Hell paradigm and ""Hard Determinism"". Chaos Theory (arguably personified by the Ewoks) can be a powerful ally in thwarting Determinism.}I rate this film at 8 stars.

If at all possible, try to avoid such things before watching this for the first time. ---A super-rare 10/10...only the 12th film to bag this rating (from over a thousand movies rated).An Epic achievement, nonstop thrill-a-minute rollercoaster ride for 150 minutes where even the quiet passages excite the senses. Not a single weak moment. Plot, cast, antagonist, dialogue, pace, music, action, camera, editing, FX, 3D, humour, drama, thrills...it all worked beautifully. It is the best at all these things from all the MCU movies so far (ok, Guardians beats it on humour but the few moments of levity in IW are welcome & powerful).The only caveat for its ranking among the very greatest movies is that to get the most out of it you really need to watch the previous 18 movies of the MCU. That build-up, all those character developments and pre-knowledge of lore is crucial.And I should know, as I first watched Infinity War last year without any of this, without any Marvel knowledge at all. Enjoyed it, well-made. But without that connection it was an 8/10 max. Not breaking my Top 100. It was thereafter checking out Guardians of the Galaxy (specifically Gamora's character and her connection to the saga) that made me ponder how a rewatch of Infinity War might be if I did all the MCU in order. It was also a recent purchase of the Meta Quest 3, and how 3D-movies look in that FOV-filling isolated screen, that persuaded me to do it. And yes, they look very impressive that way.Now done. Those first 18 movies are good-to-great (except Hulk, haha), and on to Infinity War. It's absolutely incredible! Utterly gripped, mesmerised...despite having seen it before. But now I'm armed with all that build-up. Deserves its place up there with the very best cinema has offered us these last 100 years. And the greatest action sci-fi/fantasy flick since Empire Strikes Back.It's a hard sell to persuade film fans who aren't into superhero movies to watch 18 of them just so that they can optimally experience the greatest of them.But honestly now that I've done it I have to disagree with Scorsese: MCU, specifically The Infinity Saga, is absolutely cinema.",21 December 2023

The film, divided into two compelling acts, seamlessly weaves together a narrative that is as thought-provoking as it is visually arresting.The first half of the movie is a tour de force in itself, immersing viewers in the relentless crucible of Marine Corps boot camp. R. Lee Ermey's portrayal of the unyielding drill instructor is nothing short of iconic, delivering a performance that is both terrifying and captivating. Kubrick's meticulous attention to detail in depicting the rigorous training process not only adds authenticity but also sets the stage for the emotional journey that follows.As the narrative transitions to the harsh landscapes of the Vietnam War, ""Full Metal Jacket"" continues to excel in its portrayal of the psychological toll of combat. The film follows Private Joker, portrayed with nuance by Matthew Modine, as he evolves from a wide-eyed recruit to a war correspondent. The transformation of the characters serves as a poignant commentary on the dehumanizing effects of war, prompting reflection on the profound impact it has on those who experience it.Kubrick's masterful direction is evident throughout, with every frame meticulously composed to evoke a range of emotions. The cinematography captures the brutality of war with unflinching precision, while the juxtaposition of dark humor against the backdrop of chaos adds layers of complexity to the storytelling. The result is a film that is as visually arresting as it is thematically rich.Furthermore, the soundtrack, featuring a mix of iconic tracks, complements the film's atmosphere, enhancing the emotional resonance of key moments. The carefully curated music contributes to the immersive experience, leaving a lasting impression on the audience.In conclusion, ""Full Metal Jacket"" is a cinematic tour de force that not only stands as a testament to Stanley Kubrick's directorial prowess but also as a poignant exploration of the human psyche in the face of the brutality of war. With its stellar performances, striking visuals, and thematic depth, the film remains a powerful and enduring work of art that continues to resonate with audiences, cementing its place as a classic in the war film genre.",5 December 2023

",7,"Stanley Kubrick only directed a dozen or so feature films over a span of forty plus years and only four in the second half of that period but 'Full Metal Jacket' marks a change from his last few films as it eschews exquisite photography and densely built spacial frames and returns to a more moving and somewhat less formal style. It is however very strictly marked into sections with a Marine corp training part followed by an active service deployment in the late 60's Vietnam War. Within this there is a further break between ""rear with the gear"" and ""ass in the grass"" as the film reaches its zenith in its warzone story.In all the parts of the narrative there are film and media references which suggests that 'Full Metal Jacket' is as much about war media and representation as it is a war film about fictional people in combat and combat units.Released in 1987 this is a Kubrick film that unusually feels like it's following in the footsteps of others and that's because it is. Contrary to his preceding films here Kubrick isn't cutting new ground. This is a chaptered narrative about how war treats people and how people treat war. Its removed enough from the Vietnam War to not be so much about that war, or its geopolitics, or its ideological politics but about war fighting by people in a more general way.I think that this is why it loses focus somewhere along the way and becomes a thematically tied string of military character scenarios about war experience and behaviour. The use of identifiable chapters in the narrative structure certainly reinforce this interpretation.Probably this is also why 'Full Metal Jacket' feels like it's about the media of war, indeed the middle section, or chapter, is centred on a press unit assignment for our protagonist 'Joker'; this sensation is built into the film because it isn't immediately about the Vietnam War: that war is itself a vehicle to reflect - in film making - on war making.The acting is well put forth and Kubrick gets less layered performances from his cast than in his previous two films. Similarly Kubrick directs his cameras more fluidly with less regard to depict spacial forms and more on the humans foregrounding his shots.The sound design and score are quite restrained with an all round audio mix that is again foregrounding the human dialogue.Sets are meticulous but never prominent, they are relegated to the servicemen and their actions just as the cameras frame and audio mix are, and even the film editing follows human beats. Clearly, all parts of Stanley Kubrick's film making here suggest that the characters human war making is front and centre of everything.Ultimately this, combined with the films loss of broader contextual shape and it's lateness to the canon of great American Vietnam War movies, with Kubrick following where others have stepped, means that 'Full Metal Jacket' isn't quite a winning formula for me.Certainly, the first time watching, with little or no prior warning, the opening act, the first part, the first chapter where the Marines are trained is a major feat of film making and makes a strong impression. With repeat viewings the less acclaimed second and third acts, in the field in Vietnam, gather more attention and probably tell the story of this film best: its just people doing war things and military things, that's the whole of it.I rate 7/10 and I recommend to war film fans but if you are unhappy with combat and military people and scenarios be cautious because this film directly deals with war and war machines and how people go along with that.",21 November 2023

The film is divided into two parts, with the first half of the film focusing on the training of soldiers in preparation for Vietnam, while the second half deals with their experiences during the actual war.Vincent D'Onofrio's performance in the film is arguably the best, as he masterfully portrays the slow transition of his character from a simpleton to a psychopath. The film is not your typical war movie, as it is more like a series of short stories that are loosely connected rather than one long narrative.Although the film's style is unique, it's still one of the better films about Vietnam you'll likely see.

",8,"Stanley Kubrick's penultimate film, and the last one to be released during his lifetime, was one in a line of Vietnam War movies during this period, along with among others Oliver Stone's Platoon and Barry Levinson's Good Morning Vietnam. Whereas Stone and Levinson took their productions to Southeast Asia, Kubrick filmed his picture in England, which may be claimed to give it a somewhat more artificial feel. Then again, Kubrick always did adhere to his own particular pretense, and if nothing else, Full Metal Jacket is a truly cinematic work of art. The film is basically twofold: The first part a harrowing study of the training of U. S. Marine recruits, given a painstaking realism thanks to the performance of real-life drill instructor turned actor R. Lee Ermey, who as the brutal Gunnery Sergeant Hartman shouts drill commands till kingdom come. The second part moves us into the action in Vietnam, where Kubrick assembles a collection of scenes which feel as random and unplanned as war itself despite being obviously expertly devised. Some scenes have an overly choreographed feel, but there's an undeniable intensity to it all - a magnetism which makes it hard to look away and not get invested. And like the Vietnam War itself, the film has no clean ending, no real redemption, only respite. There are many fine supporting performances by some of the less flashy young actors from the era, including Arliss Howard, Alec Baldwin and Dorian Harewood.

""Predator"" is a movie that not only entertains with its intense action and sci-fi elements but also resonates with its portrayal of the physical and psychological toll of warfare.Directed by John McTiernan and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, ""Predator"" takes us on a harrowing journey alongside a team of elite commandos as they face an unimaginable threat in the heart of the jungle. The film's portrayal of the camaraderie and brotherhood among soldiers struck a chord with me, as it highlighted the importance of trust and reliance on one another in challenging situations.The action sequences in ""Predator"" are nothing short of explosive. The relentless battles, gunfights, and hand-to-hand combat scenes are a testament to the skills and training of the soldiers. As a veteran, I appreciated the attention to detail and the realistic portrayal of combat tactics employed by the characters.Arnold Schwarzenegger's portrayal of Dutch, the team's leader, is commendable. His commanding presence and determination reflect the qualities I admire in military leaders. The film also explores the psychological impact of war through the experiences of the characters, reminding us of the toll it takes on soldiers both during and after battle.The design and execution of the Predator itself are remarkable. The creature's advanced technology, stealth abilities, and relentless pursuit create a sense of genuine threat. This resonated with me as a veteran, as it reminded me of the constant need for vigilance and adaptability in the face of danger.""Predator"" excels in portraying the harsh realities of combat, but it also delves into the bonds formed between soldiers. The film depicts the sacrifices made by these brave individuals and the lengths they would go to protect one another. This resonated deeply with me, as it reflects the unbreakable brotherhood forged in the crucible of war.While ""Predator"" may not delve deeply into character development for every member of the commando team, it effectively captures the essence of the military experience. The film's visuals, despite their age, still manage to create a believable and immersive atmosphere, transporting viewers into the heart of the conflict.However, it is worth noting that ""Predator"" occasionally relies on certain tropes and clichés commonly associated with action movies. While they may not be entirely representative of the real-life experiences of veterans, they contribute to the film's entertainment value and the overall excitement.In conclusion, ""Predator"" stands as a thrilling and thought-provoking film that resonates with veterans due to its portrayal of the bonds formed in combat and the challenges faced by soldiers. With its intense action, memorable characters, and exploration of the psychological toll of warfare, ""Predator"" remains a must-watch for those seeking a gritty an immersive military experience on the big screen.",8 November 2023

",7,"Full Metal Jacket 1980 wrongly translated into Born to Kill by master Stanley Kubrick, a film with three very well defined acts but I didn't find much connection between them, despite knowing that it is about the military evolution of American soldiers, from its presentation and introduction in the military regime until the actual confrontations, Sgt Hartman wants to record the entire war with his machine, but he has the phrase born to kill on his helmet, the same one he said to his Sgt and instructor in the first act but talking during training is easy , here we see and feel all the pressure of training and even bullying and what this can do to the minds of soldiers. In the second act, while filming and taking photographs on his vest, we see the brooch asking for peace, in a slightly more bureaucratic war area, where he could clearly have cut some scenes in which the director wanted to set us in the land of war by placing a theft sequence from the Viet Cong to the Americans and two sequences of Vietnamese prostitutes used by American soldiers. The third act then has no character development, not like what happened between the clippings of the first two acts, we see soldiers falling and the photographer having to take command of his group, and whether the phrase he carried during the film is part of it or just something written in his helmet, or if he will just be keeping something already dead or simply crying out for death. In a script that is not uniform without much connection between the acts or a lot of time or no time between them, with good performances ok photography and direction well below the average of one of the masters and still released after apocalypse now by francis ford coppolla seen born to kill an almost OK film but well below Kubrickian expectations.",25 October 2023

",10,"Full Metal Jacket is a 1987 war film directed by Stanley Kubrick. The movie is set during the Vietnam War and follows a group of U. S. Marines as they undergo basic training and are later deployed to fight in the war. The film is divided into two parts: the first part focuses on the Marines' training, while the second part follows them as they fight in Vietnam.The movie has been praised for its realistic portrayal of war and its effects on soldiers. It has also been noted for its dark humor and its commentary on the dehumanizing effects of war. The film's cinematography and soundtrack have also been widely praised.In his review of the movie, Roger Ebert notes that ""Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket' is more like a book of short stories than a novel. Many of the passages seem self-contained, some of them are masterful and others look like they came out of the bottom drawer."" Ebert goes on to say that while the movie is ""one of the best-looking war movies ever made on sets and stages,"" it falls short when compared to other war movies such as ""Platoon,"" ""Apocalypse Now,"" and ""The Deer Hunter.""Despite this criticism, ""Full Metal Jacket"" has been widely regarded as one of Kubrick's best films. The movie's opening sequence, which shows the Marines undergoing basic training, has become iconic and has been parodied in numerous films and TV shows. The film's portrayal of the dehumanizing effects of war has also been praised, with some critics noting that it is one of the most accurate depictions of war ever put on film.The performances in ""Full Metal Jacket"" have also been widely praised.

rw9329820,ur33162918,tt0093058," Kubrick develops the characters calmly, allowing the viewer to learn about many of their characteristics during training and follow their complete transformation
",8,"If the viewer is looking for a film full of action, with explosions and crazy shootouts in ""Full Metal Jacket"", they will be disappointed. The script by Michael Herr and Stanley Kubrick, based on a book by Gustav Hasford, develops the characters calmly, allowing the viewer to learn about many of their characteristics during training and follow their complete transformation. Furthermore, it clearly divides the narrative into two parts: training and war. Therefore, during half of the projection we are introduced to the cruel methods used to train young soldiers and only in the second half do the conflicts really come into play.Interestingly, the best part of the narrative is in the first half. It is extremely captivating to follow fascinating characters like Sergeant Hartman and soldiers Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio) and Joker (Matthew Modine) during the training phase. Ironically, the biggest problem with ""Full Metal Jacket"" happens at the turning point between training and war, when the two best characters in the film tragically leave the scene, which clearly weakens the second half of the film. This problem could be alleviated by Martin Hunter's editing, if the two stories were told simultaneously. This way, the impact of the narrative would be much greater on the viewer, who would try to find out why Pyle didn't go with the others to war. ""Would he have given up?"" we could think, and the surprise would come at the end with the impactful outcome of the training. Unfortunately, this shocking ending to the training is presented in the first half of the film and leaves the viewer ""orphaned"" of the best characters so far. Despite this, the editing works very well throughout the exciting part of the training, which continues at an intense and pleasant pace, and is also competent in the sequences in Vietnam, full of energy and realism.The prologue on Parris Island opposes the Vietnamese episodes as order to disorder. The backwards traveling shots, the arrangement of the places, the rigor of the formation ritual suggest an implacable, suffocating, claustrophobic logic. The combat scenes impose another form of confinement through lateral camera movements, accumulated debris and ruins, cacophonies, and piled-up corpses. For Kubrick, two dangers threaten the world: order and disorder. In the training narrative arc, Kubrick delivers a package that uses every resource at its disposal to sterilize and condemn individuality. In Hartman's first speech, the camera follows him head-on, maintaining the same distance to the character throughout his speech. In a pornographically symmetrical environment and with uniformed recruits with shaved heads, there is no feeling of displacement in the sergeant's walk. The static men as decorative objects make it seem like Hartman is speaking to no one but himself. And it's true. That's why he doesn't bother to know their names, arbitrarily calling them Joker, Cowboy (Arliss Howard), Snowball (Peter Edmund) and Gomer Pyle - the same name as the silly mechanic from an American sitcom from the 60s.Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio's first major role, Daredevil's Wilson Fisk) represents both the brokenness of the individual and the indifference of the collective. His laughter - punished by self-hanging - indicates that he was the only one capable of seeing the absurdity of that hoax. His mistakes are punished more severely because Hartman sees in him a desire to be different from others. In the Cartesian world of Parris Island, any threat to order must be rooted out. And it is when the group understands the burly recruit as an obstacle between training and the battlefield that, at the ""blanket party"", the last thread of empathy for anyone seen as different is broken. Marines are brothers of marines and are indifferent to others. This also represents the point of no return for Pyle, when he finds himself absolutely alone and, consequently, free from any commitment to those men.Once again, Kubrick extracts impeccable technical work from his team that results in the film's beautiful visuals, as we can see through the costumes by Keith Denny and the art direction by Keith Pain, Nigel Phelps, Rod Stratfold and Leslie Tomkins, who set the scene. Competently the viewer takes in the film's atmosphere both in training and in combat, through the war uniforms and, mainly, the exceptional view of the city's wreckage, in the third act. It is also worth highlighting the good photography direction by Douglas Milsome, which highlights the green, which is becoming less and less alive - as well as the hope within those hardened hearts - mixed with the gray, which symbolizes the sadness of those young soldiers. Finally, it is worth highlighting the good soundtrack by Vivian Kubrick, composed of excellent songs.Four points in the Vietnam arc deserve a specific analysis: female participation, the function of the press, narrative contradictions and the psychological concept of the Shadow. Unlike the Freudian school, in which the Id represents the primitive part of the personality responsible for the reckless search for pleasure, the Swiss Carl Gustav Jung classifies the Shadow as the unconscious part of the human personality. The purchase of a pair of sneakers would be explained by Freud as a clash between the Id (""I want to buy these sneakers"") and the Ego (""it costs a lot"") mediated by the Superego (""I'm going to pay for the purchase in installments""); Jung would focus on the unconscious desire to be accepted by the group in which the individual is part, motivating the conscious purchase of such sneakers. This contrast appears clearly in Joker, who wears a helmet with the inscription ""Born to Kill"" and a brooch with the peace symbol. He even makes mention of the ""Jungian thing"" of human duality. But not just there: Hartman conditions the learning of his recruits on the abandonment of critical sense and Pyle is approved as a marine when he becomes a sociopath. In the accurate choice of songs in Full Metal Jacket, Kubrick also creates the strangeness of double meaning, as in the iconic scene of journalists documenting a military offensive to the sound of ""Bird Is the Word"".The ""bird"" is clearly the eagle, symbol of the United States. And Trashmen's almost non-song turns a moment that would be treated as a patriotic monument in 99% of war films into a huge joke. An absurdity in which the soldiers don't even know why they take part. Paradoxically, the complete critical apathy only shows how well those men were taught. At the same time as they know how to fight a senseless war, they shamelessly manipulate public opinion with fake news. The effect of Stars and Stripes, Joker and Rafterman's (Kevyn Major Howard) newspaper, is perverse in its efficiency: if the soldiers believe their stories, the war is a lie; If you believe your own eyes, the Armed Forces are a lie. In both cases, the only response is nihilistic cynicism. It's when he goes to the field that Joker sees a soldier killing civilians for nothing and begins to question the purpose of war. His breaking process had already begun in training, as the conscious decision to attack Pyle comes from an unconscious desire to please Instructor Hartman's father figure and to belong to the platoon he led. And, in the final decision, your point of no return, killing the Viet Cong sniper is in a gray area: mercy or pleasure in killing?It is interesting to note that three women appear in ""Full Metal Jacket"", all in Vietnam: two prostitutes and the aforementioned sniper. Prostitutes are offered as merchandise to American soldiers, who bargain. The sniper, the only presence of the enemy in the entire film, is the perfect symmetry of those marines: as the prayer in the first arc says, ""I need to shoot better than my enemy, who is trying to kill me; I need to shoot him before he shoots me; And I will."" She validates her own humanity, by Marine standards, by being an effective killer. Joker may have killed her as an act of respect for his valiant enemy or for sadistic pleasure, which would explain the ""award for ugliness"". When Joker walks through the burning ruins in the night of Hue, highlighting the knowledge that he is in a ""sh**** world"", but happy to be alive and not feel afraid, we can conclude either that he has found the meaning of existence or that the lack of meaning does not bothers him more. Dramatically, his response to both possibilities is the same: kill. Kubrick reserves the right not to make moral judgments about this, leaving it up to the viewer to decide whether Joker will find pleasure in this or not.Kubrick, like other important filmmakers throughout the history of cinema, also studied war and the effects it causes on the human mind. The insanity of war led, for example, to a marine shooting children and women in the fields of Vietnam, in another shocking scene in the film. In the director's view, the distance between peace and extreme violence is small in the human mind. ""Full Metal Jacket"" shows how the army turns young people into true killing machines, just as war hardens their hearts, altering their view of the world forever. Competently directed and acted, it is still a great film, but it could be even better with some small adjustments. In any case, it leaves its message, even if it is not as forceful as other works by the exceptional director. Any praise for Stanley Kubrick's work, two decades after his death, risks falling into the common grave of banality. It is trivial to recognize him as one of the greatest cinema directors of all time. Identifying what makes this a monument to the Seventh Art is the challenge. ""Full Metal Jacket"" perfectly portrays its main qualities. A work that provides tools to be interpreted until the last moment. In the final credits, ""Paint It, Black"", by the Rolling Stones, provides the only unquestionable truth in two hours of projection. It's not easy to face the world when everything is black.",18 September 2023
rw9322590,ur13995491,tt0093058," Visually striking, darkly funny, aimless
",8,"I'm not sure exactly how I feel about this one. Kubrick is certainly a visionary and interesting director, but Full Metal Jacket feels a bit ambiguous and aimless. It's often intense and engaging overall, but lacks a cohesive overarching structure. I feel like I'm missing some deeper point to it, but the simpler answer is that what I'm looking for is just not there.People seem to rave about the first third of the movie with R. Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio at the army barracks during training. But while I liked the acting and some of the intensity, it also felt a bit boring to me. It doesn't feel like anything meaningful is going on and I'm unsure what the point of it is.It also gets repetitive. Okay, a drill sergeant constantly yelling at his soldiers/trainees. Great. What, for 40 minutes? Okay. Is this meant to be a realistic simulation of boot camp? Or is it meant to be an exaggeration? Is this meant to show how harsh training can be? Or is it meant to be funny? I mean, I honestly burst out laughing at Ermey multiple times. He's not wrong a lot of the time! ""Are you kidding me?!? You can't even do ONE pull-up?!?"" That was hilarious.The movie also seems to be ambiguous about ""Gomer Pyle"". Is he mentally challenged? It certainly seems that way. But also, he's quite good with guns. What does it matter though? He ends up dying so all his character qualities were for nought. Did he kill Ermey because he was so mean to him? Or would he have killed any instructor from the workload? Was it because he was already a bit insane and unstable? It's hard to know. Even quite a normal person might start to hate Ermey's overbearing attitude.The other soldiers take their frustration out on ""Pyle"" by taking turns beating him with soap wrapped in towels. This is highly disturbing but we can understand their frustration. But I'm left thinking the whole situation is stupid. These are adults and this is war. You need to grow up and make smart decisions. Either this Pyle guy is competent enough to train or not. He should've just been kicked out straight away. Or segregated and put in a special program. The others shouldn't beat him but should make a formal complaint. He would be a liability out in the field.The sergeant himself is a mix between strict, funny and way too aggressive. Some of what he says is just true. Some of it is crude but pretty standard for how guys talk to each-other. But much of it is also just ridiculous - screaming at the top of his lungs over nothing. A waste of energy. I would request to move to a different group, not because I can't handle pressure or hard work, but because the sergeant is edgy and borderline insane.The rest of the movie is similarly ambiguous. I'm not sure whether to laugh or be disturbed or both. Maybe that's the point and maybe that's brilliant and deep. Or maybe it's shallow and lazy.Take the guy shooting from the helicopter. He's laughing like crazy, shooting into thin air, it seems. Then we see his point of view - he's shooting random rice farmers, innocent civilians, many of them women. Are we meant to be shocked? Horrified? Gagging like the other guy in the helicopter? Did this ever actually happen in Vietnam? Once or twice, maybe. Or was it common? I couldn't help but laugh. This guy is insane, loves killing and the movie just kinda glosses over it. Why include this? Especially if it was probably extremely rare or entirely fictionalised?Take the final, elongated sequence where the main characters are dealing with a sniper. It's a predictable and hilarious comedy-of-errors. First one guy, standing in the open, gets shot. But not fatally. The others take cover and start shooting like crazy. Finally they stop firing and debate what to do. The first guy gets hit again and screams, then they all shoot again until their captain tells them to stop again.The firing achieves nothing. It's absolutely moronic in terms of strategy - it wastes ammo, gives away your position, hits no targets and makes it harder to find the enemy because of all the commotion. Then of course another guy goes to rescue the first one. Can you guess what happens? They get hit, scream in slow motion and they all shoot like crazy again. I felt like I was watching a Key and Peele sketch. It's actually a pretty funny idea, but I can't tell if Kubrick was going for comedy.After several of them get killed by not taking cover, finally they corner the sniper and, lo-and-behold, it's a teenage girl. Is this realistic? I'm sure some soldiers in a war like this were young or were girls. But this feels like a cheap idea by Kubrick. Yes, it messes with our feelings. This savage, deadly sniper who just murdered several main characters is just a girl! You're ready for them to just tear this sniper to shreds, but now you feel bad that they're shooting a kid.Then she's breathing there, bleeding to death. Whispering some kind of prayer. What am I meant to feel or think about this? Horror? Confusion? Emptiness?Whatever. None of this feels particularly insightful. War is bad. Yes. Got it. That's actually very obvious. Kubrick doesn't give any time to the reasons for the Vietnam war. Or to military strategy or bureaucracy or to any specific moral dilemmas. He just focuses on having one intense or weird scene after another. It actually feels quite slow and deliberate, rather than fast-paced. It's engaging, but still left me feeling a bit bored and wanting more. More meaning. More sharpness and clarity.If Kubrick is saying that humans are capable of evil - sure. But why? How do we end up like that? No answers or even ideas are offered. Modine's character is fine and somewhat neutral - a means for us to vicariously experience the events of the movie. But nothing he experiences feels all that enlightening. I see inefficiency, bad choices, insane people, incompetence and some of the disturbing outcomes of any war. But I see nobody doing anything about it or pointing out the obvious.Nobody says ""gee, our drill sergeant is a bit over-the-top isn't he?"" Or ""is this really necessary?"" Nobody says ""let's try to carefully but quickly flank this sniper, staying in cover the whole time. Let's get a visual and rough idea of where the sniper is."" ""Why is this psychopath murdering innocent people in fields - would his superiors actually defend this? How does it help us win the war?"" ""Why are we even fighting in Vietnam? Are we the good guys, in which case we should be patriotic, confident and not dwell on the sorrows of war, or is this unnecessary, in which case we should just pull out and end the misery?""There's room for different opinions on war and Vietnam specifically. But Kubrick seems to offer nothing solid. Maybe it's because I'm a mathematician - I like getting answers. And even in politics and war, there are answers. Some wars are necessary. Some strategies work better than others. Some countries committed worse evils than others. Moral principles do exist.Full Metal Jacket is a bold and entertaining movie, but one with very little of value to say. War is bad - of course it is. It works somewhat as a very dark comedy. And that's certainly deliberate in part. It's subtle but there. Kubrick likes playing with juxtaposition and expectations. He uses upbeat pop songs for much of the movie.It's just way too over-the-top to take too seriously. And as a dark comedy, it is pretty funny and makes some interesting if scattered points about war and what it's like to live through it. But it doesn't commit fully to this and seems to want to be a drama or commentary as well - at which it is much less successful.",14 September 2023

His official brief is little more that fact finding, but he has greater ambitions - to unite the Arab peoples, deploy them in the fight against the Turks, and inspire them to an independent one-nation future.Lawrence existed in real life. How accurate the story telling is is open to debate of course, and my review puts aside that matter.The two stars of the film are the landscapes, and Lawrence - played by Peter O'Toole.The cinematography makes the most of the wide open desert settings, and although I haven't had the pleasure of watching this on a cinema screen I would imagine that is where the scenery would look most impressive.The character of Lawrence, and the casting of O'Toole, is a fascinating one that works really well. It might have been tempting to put an all action, macho, Steve McQueen type character into this lead role, but they didn't - presumably to closer match the true life character. Lawrence is portrayed as a sometimes macho, sometimes effeminate, deeply complex and certainly flawed character, capable of love and hate, compassion and violence, egotism and selflessness.

",9,"People aren't great watching long movies. It's not a generational thing. Seeing this at a cinema I thought would be a dream come true, but the crowd was restless and kind of loud... but they weren't the worst part by any means. The cinema didn't do a great job of showing this. The sound was way too quiet (I even made a Karen of myself by going out and complaining - realized too late I missed that cool scene transition where he blows out the match, too... and if they did increase the volume, it was minimal), and they played it in one of the smaller cinemas... so it sold out, was super cramped, the screen wasn't super big, and there was only one exit, so any time someone got up, you noticed. Usually, the popular classics that are re-screened get the biggest room in the house.Plus the projectionist didn't realize the screen was supposed to be black during the overture, so there were 15 minutes of technical difficulties that weren't actual technical difficulties (I was also a Karen about this - I just want to do anything I can to not be an apathetic bystander in situations like these, even though I feel like a jerk no matter how polite I try to be).I guess it was still Lawrence of Arabia in a cinema, but it's been a dream of mine to see this in a cinema since watching it on DVD more than a decade ago (to be fair, in 2012, DVDs still looked pretty decent to my eyes, but it was never doing the film true justice). They didn't screen it anywhere near me in 2022, which is when the film had it 60th anniversary, which was odd. I love the cinema they did screen it at tonight, and I've had so many great experiences there I can't say it'll turn me off continuing to go there. It's just a pity that the one bad screening I've had there in years was for Lawrence of Arabia, which is kind of THE epic movie that you're supposed to see at the movies.The film's great though, as everyone knows. Maybe it feels a tiny bit overlong to me, but there's a chance that the screening tainted my enjoyment (if I try to be as objective as possible, I still recognize this is an amazingly well-made film). I don't feel like I've crossed off something from my bucket list, though - I still feel like I need to see Lawrence of Arabia in a cinema, even though tonight, I technically saw Lawrence of Arabia in a cinema, which makes me a bit sad.",4 December 2023

",8,"Lawrence of Arabia has been rightly celebrated as one of David Leans Masterpieces. It is massive and tremendous in every sense of the word- massive in length, massive in scope, and massive in scenery. Cinematographer Freddie Young has a filmed a gargantuan movie which has the rare ability of bleeding out of your screen- anyone viewing on a small screen will feel woefully inadequate. Young has succeeded magnificently, for he captures in stupendous waves of sand and sky, both the magnificence, the wonder, and the endless, vast expanse of forbidding the desert presents. The battle scenes are also captured in great detail and in great scope, thousands of men filling your entrie screen. An astounding feat. The extraordinary music by Maurice Jarre brilliant in accentuating this atmosphere- Jarres score evokes the grandeur of the desert, and also conveys a unique exoticism in its atmosphere. The acting and writing also deserves praise. Peter O Toole is astonishing as Lawrence. Lawrence becomes a veritable prophet, a messiah in the desert, but he is far from invincible. The film breaks him down using a harrowing experience with a Turkish general, and does well in humanising him. Lawrence is not portrayed as infallible- he is emotional, and liable to tantrums and emotional outbursts. Omar Shariff is also excellent as his conscience, his ally Sheriff Ali. The writing does well in maintains a lively pace. The dialogue is always intelligent, crisp, and sharp, which keeps the audience interest. The film runs for almost 4 hours but it feels nothing like it's length. However my issue with the film is here- while it does not feel like 4 hours, it does feel long. I find around 40 minutes could have been cut from this film. The scenes in the second part(after the intermission) also loses a bit of pace compared the preceding section. Whereas the first section was a stunning masterpiece of not only great beauty, but also of taut pace, the second part does slog on a bit, with what little plot stretched too thinly. Perhaps this is because the freshness and intrigue of the desert is starting to dissipate, as the movie slows. All in all, Lawrence of Arabia and its visual splendour is something I have not seen on screen before at all. But it's second part keeps it from being something truly great, something which can, like Lawrence, unify and conquer the disparate tastes and hearts of all.",3 December 2023

",8,"I had to read several other reviews to focus on what seems to be the important elements of this film. I'm grateful to the reviewers.I first saw the film at the age of 17, thought it was a great flick, and then pretty much forgot about it. I didn't understand the plot (what were the Brits and the French after, anyway?) but I did feel the gorgeous beauty of the photography and the locales, which formed a good basis for appreciating the film as I grew older.I have just seen the film again, in its socalled restored version. One technical word (as something of a technician myself): I say ""socalled"" because of the audio. Rarely have I seen a British film that gets the sound right. American films get it wonderfully right, with a sense of presence and clarity that the Brits somehow manage to mangle. That's a severe weakness of this film--even if it was restored.But getting to the heart of the matter.... My impression, in view of rave reviews of O'Toole and his acting, is that Sharif was the real star of the show (almost, that is). His character enters as a ""cruel and barbarous"" murderer but then slowly and convincingly evidences the humanity that makes his character virtually fall in love with the difficult Lawrence. In contrast, I found O'Toole's changes (not growth, but devolution) in the course of the film rather stilted, as if O'Toole lacked the experience and depth of his costar (and that's probably true). I can see how Sharif later turned into Zhivago, while I doubt that O'Toole could have handled such a role nearly as well.Lawrence of Arabia is about life, and it takes decades of life to appreciate its meaning (at least it did for me). As was said at the end of the film, young men make war and old men make the peace--and it must be so. The world is an old, old place, and our youthful dreams and aspirations and perceptions must eventually turn into the more sober and dejected outlooks of the mature. But that doesn't mean that older age is full of depression: appreciating the undulations of life and of our dreams is just part of the deal we get from God and the cosmos.Somehow, in some inexplicable way, I sense that this was Lean's message, and he delivered it well.",21 November 2023

The screenplay by Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson is based on this book.The use of Super Panavision technology, with David Lean's angles and perspectives, to narrate the eminently idealistic life of a cosmopolitan legend who, in addition to his mother tongue, also spoke Arabic, French, German, Greek, Latin and Turkish achieved legendary status.

I seen this on rental and I must confess AFTER watching the first hour and 10 or 20 minutes of this film was when I finally got involved. It was up to the part when Eli finally allowed Oskar into her suite and then to the living room staring at each other through a thick glass door that was separating them (that scene alone makes the overall film ever more powerful) since the first half of this film was all too conventional and familiar which after the first killing I must admit I ended up fast-forwarding some scenes because I started asking questions into my head, like if I were to witness a killing should I inform the law about it ASAP and if I were to take the law into my own hands that to make sure I were to be prepared for a backup plan!! What this movie manages to do extremely well was putting a humanistic side between the two leads which is Oskar and then Eli and not so much on the victims who weren't chosen but who were just random people!!!

",7,"3 years after the end of World War 2, a tribunal is taking place against 4 former Nazi judges who are trial for crimes against humanity whilst they were in office. Retired American chief judge Dan Haywood is presiding over their trial along with 2 other judges. As something of an outsider, Haywood must listen to all of the facts and evidence presented whilst doing a bit of digging himself to try and find out what really happened, but what will his verdict be?No matter how much acclaim a film achieves by the awards committee or how highly its rated on IMDB I always have concerns when a film runs for 3 hours or more (rarely is it necessary for films to go on that long). However, Judgment at Nuremberg is an example of a film where the length is possibly justified. There's a lot of evidence to be presented, witnesses from both sides who need to give their testimonies etc. Haywood has to do some of his own investigations outside of the court which gives these scenes purpose and meaning... true they are probably less interesting than the trial itself, but I can understand why these scenes were necessary to the story.The mood and atmosphere of the film are pretty much perfect; there's a sort of claustrophobia about the court scenes and a lot of the actors perform with passion and intensity. Again if I was to be critical then I would say that, at times, the film can be guilty of being a bit over-dramatised, over-acted, and maybe a tad forceful (some of the numerous zoom in shots look a bit silly in this day and age, but may have been received better at the time). However, in the grand scheme of things these are minor drawbacks and on the whole the film is presented in a powerful manner.The directing is solid (aside from some of the points I've raised in the aforementioned paragraph). Despite the 3 hour length, both Kramer and Mann keep the film tight and focussed and there is rarely a dull moment in this cinematic epic.At times the film is also powerful in its delivery and its hard not to be moved and possibly even slightly disturbed by what you see and hear in this film. As I say it's not all perfectly done, but it gets a lot more right than it does wrong.I'm aware that this is a fictionalised account of the Nuremberg trial so I'm not going to take all of this as gospel, but the overall package that was presented to me here was very well done.For fans of classic cinema this is definitely worth checking out.",15 October 2023

Turns out they didn't. The first hour or so drags somewhat, and some scenes feel pointless. This really did not need to be 3 hours at all. Additionally, this movie is very very dialogue heavy, even for a courtroom drama. If you miss just one piece of information in any of the courtroom scenes, you will not have a clue what they're talking about for the rest of that scene. Maybe this was easier to follow back in 1961, considering the trials were probably well-known about at the time, but now, in the 21st century, it is a bit of a challenge to wrap your head around this film completely. I was surprised that they didn't simplify what they were talking about, or make it easier for the viewer to understand.But onto the positives now. Maximilian Schell, round. Of. Applause. Astounding performance as Hans Rolfe, truly staggering. He was so convincing in his role as a German defense attorney enraged at what the Nazis had done that I actually had to search up whether or not Schell was German himself. That just goes to show how passionate and emotionally driven he made his character seem to be. It shouldn't have surprised me that he won Best Leading Actor at the Oscars. And this was accompanied by remarkable showings from the likes of Burt Lancaster (as Ernst Janning), Spencer Tracy (as Judge Dan Haywood), and Montgomery Clift (as Rudolph Petersen). In fact, you could probably say the entire cast was extraordinary.What was so unexpected to me when I watched this was for it to be that emotional, if at all, since courtroom dramas tend to be much more informative and emotionless in a way. But there is one particular scene that comes almost out of nowhere that is unbelievably devastating and shockingly bleak. Just awful, it hurts to even think about it, so I won't go on anymore. All I'll say is, they certainly didn't hold anything back.One final thing I would like to mention that makes this feature so unique to any other that I've watched is that, this is the only movie I've ever ever watched that I've been unable to figure out whose side I'm even meant to be on: in this case, guilty or not guilty. That. Is. Incredible. It really makes you think about things, heck it forces you to. I couldn't even tell what verdict Judge Haywood himself was going to choose! Man I wonder what watching this in 1961 was like, at a time when many of the people still around had experienced the effects of the war first-hand.So overall, an exceptional film.

",7,"Judgment at Nuremburg mixes history, morality, and legality in a compelling court-house drama. It asks the question, should civilian judges be found guilty of Nazi crimes against humanity for their role in upholding Nazi law?It's not a simple answer and the film does well to make you empathise with a range of views and people. This exploration is the gigantic, timeless heart of the film.It's complimented with a star-studded cast, though being born 30 years after the film was made, not one I recognise. The acting is good, with the caveat that in some scenes, performances suffer from actors being directed to be over-the-top, such as the unusually aggressive verbal bouts from the defence lawyer. There are other directorial choices I question, such as the over-use of zoom. The above might have been common for the time, or used to be novel, but in either case do not seem to stand the test of time. At 3 hours, the film is also a tad long for its content.Overall, I enjoyed it, but I haven't come to canonise it, and I believe in rating films objectively, and not simply as a product of their time.

rw9145472,ur35683824,tt0055031," A lot of difficult ethical questions about the exact nature of quilt
",8,"""Judgement at Nuremberg"" ia a court room drama. It is however not about the main Nuremberg proces judging the political Nazi bosses, but about one of the side processes judging the judges who applied Nazi laws.With a duration of nearly three hours the film runs the risk of getting somewhat monotonous. Director Stanley Kramer mitigates this risk in various ways. In the first place he alternates interior scenes with exterior scenes. One of the most memorable exterior scenes is the visit of judge Haywood (Spencer Tracy) to the station of Nuremberg, where the party gatherings of the Nazi took place. The station is empty now but it is almost impossible not to think about "" Triumph des Willens"". (1935, Leni Riefenstahl).Another way to avoid monotonousness is giving much screentime to the stories of the victims. In this way the film takes on the character of an ensemble movie.The most complex part of the film is however the question of the guilt of the culprits. As already said they were judges during the Nazi period. To what extent is a judge applying prevailing law guilty? To what extent can judges be expected to make an ethical judgement about prevailing law? To what extent may judges take into account the risks they run themselves if they do not apply Nazi laws? If a judge quit his job in all probability another one will do the dirty work. Is limiting the damage as much as possible a legitimate defense? All difficult ethical questions with no easy answer.There was also an ethical dilemma for director Stanley Kramer to solve. Shortly after the end of World War Two the Cold War began. In this war West Germany was an ally, so the American government didn't want too much of the German elite to be prosecuted. You can see the same theme in ""Der Staat gegen Fritz Bauer"". (2015, Lars Kraume). Judge Haywood does not succumb to the pressure and also director Kramer does not hide this uncomfortable element.",25 June 2023

",8,"The thing about Stanley Kramer is that he took big, important idea/questions and crammed them into the framework of mainstream Hollywood filmmaking. Sometimes he did this pretty successfully. Frequently he did not.The danger is that even when it does work ... and it does work here ... the ideas get distorted as they get stuffed into a popular drama. This film, which dramatizes the 1948 trial of four judges who worked for the Nazi regime, tackles so many questions that most of them are just left hanging by the end of the film. The film spends a lot of time talking about the conflict between one's personal moral responsibilities and one's responsibilities to a job or country. That's an interesting question, but the film spends a lot of time establishing that the judges convicted people regardless of the evidence, which would be illegal within the confines of German law, even during the Nazi regime. Much of the film seems wildly overdetermined in this way, making a hash out of the questions it raises.What the film seems to be ultimately about is not whether your average German state functionary was even partly responsible for the Holocaust, but whether the thought processes that lead even decent people to be complicit in these kind of crimes is an ongoing problem that persists outside of the confines of wildly criminal regimes like the Nazis. The Soviet blockade of Berlin is introduced in the film's final act and provides a strong motive for the Americans to go easy on the defendants. The overall picture is of even decent people repeatedly being asked to do questionable things ""for the good of their country"".",31 May 2023

This is a movie everybody should watch, because it is still relevant today.Stanley Kramer who has directed this movie did an incredible job. There were moments the camera work was insane, it is a shame he did not won an oscar for that.The acting is also most extraordinary, with Spencer Tracy and Burt Lancaster delivering as usual and the outstanding performance of Maximilian Schell, who won an oscar for best actor. This guy was insane changing from a calm and smart lawyer to a furious man that reminded me of Hitler's way of speaking. This is a well deserved oscar!But maybe the most important aspect of this movie is the writing. A film of 189 minutes length cannot survive without excellent writing. Luckily, this movie has it. Not one single minute felt slow or even boring. Everything of this movie is important. That is an achievement I have seen not so often.Last but not least I have to talk about the music, especially the ouverture, intermission and ending music. You hear a german ""Marschsong"" soldiers sang while marching to the front. This of course creates a contrast to the serious tone of the movie. For me as a german it was uncomfortable to watch that.So in the end Judgment of Nuremberg is definitely not a movie for pure entertainment. It is sad, dark and definitely lets you feel bad after watching. But not like many other depressing movies, this one feels like a valuable lesson.

Otherwise...While Endgame was also a fan-service movie, the premise was acceptable, stakes felt tense, the characters acted 'in-character' and the whole production was pulled off very smoothly.No Way Home is similar in fan-service only, everything else doesn't match Endgame's quality:the premise is so blatantly contrived by Doctor Strange's out-of-character irresponsible illogical behaviour that I had trouble the entire movie suspending my disbelief. So much for him being 'the adult in the room'.the stakes never felt particular interesting. It was all a bit 'so what?'.Tom Holland's battered fish-out-of-water shtick is getting old. By the third movie the hero should be quite emotionally grown already.the attempted redemption of the villains only cheapens them as characters. If they have no agency, then they have no 'character'. Endgame had a similar problem when resetting Thanos's motivations but that character still felt like an epic threat, which is what we want from such movies. Otherwise, where is the tension or excitement gonna come from?the plot-resolution was so over-the-top and logically-ridiculous. We obviously accept a lot of nonsense from superhero movies, but they still require a certain quality of internal-logic, otherwise you can literally just make anything up.Overall not a bad film, of course. It was well-made, fairly entertaining despite the flaws. Pacing ok. Good work from the cast. Zendaya decent value again, tho' her character is morphing into the 'crying damsel/emotional sponge' trope. Some fun FX, even if the Mirror Universe was more interesting in the first Strange movie (and Peter Parker's ""it's just geometry"" to get the better of the Master of the Mystic Arts was eye-rollingly poor).From the three Spider-Man films only Homecoming was a really good one. The other two are skippable. No Way Home has a whopping 8.2 rating on here, which I think makes it the highest-rated MCU movie outside of Infinity War/Endgame. So I expect especially Spider-Man fans to love it. But for casuals who are looking for the quality of the best Infinity Saga movies...well, this one may be a disappointment.Personally, I'm almost done with Marvel, just gonna do the second Doctor Strange movie, and finish with Guardians 3.

While it was great to see the previous Spider Man actors and actors like Dafoe and Molina again, this was the only thing interesting about the movie, that means it lives purely on nostalgia.It also has to because the narrative is utterly nonsensical: Why does Dr Strange help Peter by changing the past with hardly any hesitation?Peter chose to be Spider-Man and the risk of his identity being revealed was part of that. He does not even try to change his future by himself before asking Strange to change the past for him (as Strange notes when he asks him if he has tried to contact and talk to the MIT committee).

",8,"There truly was no way home for Peter Parker, it is what ""No Way Home"" excelled at so well, writing a seemingly concluding chapter for our Spider-man within the MCU. ""No Way Home"" knew how to combine purposeful strategic storytelling with much needed fan service to deliver a piece of cinema that was straight up a comic book on the big screen.Set following the tragic fight with Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) that portrayed Peter Parker (Tom Holland) as the killer of the so called hero, our Spidey now suffers and must deal with, the consequences of trying to live two lives. It is his choice to try make the world forget that he is Spider-man that sets in motion the series of events, some may say multiversal, that give Peter his biggest challenge yet.The brilliance of Tom Holland's Spider-man shines as usual yet undergoes some much needed change facing challenges throughout and the path Tom takes his Spider-man on is a highly anticipated one with our Spider-man finally not holding his punches back. Zendaya's MJ and Jacob Batalon's Ned as always serve their comedic purpose yet now sprinkled with a touch of sadness and seriousness as our friends support their friend Peter on a quite demanding journey with many surprises along the way.No longer caring for spoilers, the welcomed cast of Villains is a trip down memory lane: We are so happy to be reintroduced to Willem Defoe's Green Goblin, as menacing as ever and very much two-faced. Our dear Alfred Molina reprises the much loved Doctor Octopus though for once fighting on the right side of justice, seemingly. The remainder of the villainous cast, Jamie Foxx's Electro, Rhys Ifans Reptile, the cunning Dr Curtis Connors and Thomas Haden's Sandman bring to the table the perfect culmination of villainy from the universes of the Spider-man movies we have come to love. As for our Spider-men, happy to be speaking plurally for now, Tobey Maguire's and Andrew Garfield's Spider-man were screams-of-joy inducing appearances on the big screen. The appearance of Andrew Garfield's confused spider-man bought for me literal tears of joy, no movie has quite made me feel like a child again as much as this. Tobey Maguire's Spidey as well was much needed, the first Spider-man that bought me such love for this character now back and swinging alongside our still young, still learning, Spider-man from Earth-616. The remainder of the cast such as J. K Simmons J. Jonah Jameson, Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange and even Charlie Cox's brief Matt Murdock bring so much to the table in regard to bringing this movie alive and every character serves their purpose well, building this story alongside the main purpose that is served by our Spidey, on his mission to pick a life to live.For me the biggest charms that ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" possessed were seen so much in the way the story served a purpose, contrary to popular fan belief that the return of Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield's respectful Spideys were fan service, they were much needed for the development of Tom Holland's Spider-man, plus seeing them be face to face with their life-long villains, for one last time, ties very well into the film. Ties to the previous instalment as to give this one a base to start from, and a reason for Peter wanting everyone to forget him, equally did so much for world building, pushing Peter into wanting to be forgotten and thus starting a multiverse ripple. Everywhere throughout there is emotion and a feel that an end is coming and it won't be one we will shed tears of joy over, yet the action sequences and events that lead up to that tumultuous end are perfect puzzle pieces. Some parts however that could have been given more attention is to the role played by certain characters, it is right to feel that characters like Dr Curtis Connors and Sandman were simple wastes of CGI budge, as good as their performances were when given the opportunity to perform, aside from that they did not do much to be remembered for and it drags the movie down quite often, painting it as wasted fan service.For me the important part of No Way Home that makes it such a movie close to heart is in its messages, not just for the real world but for the overall story within the MCU. The morals Tom Holland's Peter Parker has had to learn, finally being introduced to the idea that With great power, comes great responsibility"" adds that turning point in Spider-man's character, having to lose something great to finally realise he cannot live two lives. As for me myself, the movie is a story in some aspects of redemption and being given a second chance yet also of realising that sometimes if you truly love something, you have to walk away. ""Spider-Man No Way Home"" showed me the good and the bad of friendships and generalities of life that sometimes, as the motto goes, leaves us with great responsibility.""Spider-Man No Way Home"" in general painted itself as a movie for any age group, be it you are a kid who puts on a mask and believes himself Spider-Man, which you are since anyone can wear the mask. Or be it that you are now grown up, and childhood sparkle of imagination has left you, leaving you only with the love for this universe thus finally seeing your three generations of Spider-Men on one screen, ""No Way Home"" is perfect for all. It may not be the best movie nor the seemingly best conclusion for Peter Parker in the MCU, regardless Jon Watts blew it out the park and created a memorable film that kept the charm of the MCU, that we have loved and continue to love, alive.""Spider-Man No Way Home"" regardless of sometimes confusing use of fan service, or some minor discrepancies here and there, is worthy of the score of 8.2/10. No Spider-Man movie could have so well concluded chapters to some of our favorite villains while equally, as sad as it may be, take our Peter Parker in such a drastically different direction.",30 December 2023

",3,"As a long-time fan of the Spider-Man franchise, it pains me to write this review. The latest installment, unfortunately, feels like nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to milk every last drop from the beloved series. Titled with the promise of exhilarating adventures, the film instead delivers a tangled mess of recycled plots and superficial thrills that fail to capture the essence of what made Spider-Man great.From the outset, it's clear that the movie relies heavily on the brand name to pull in audiences. The storyline, if one can call it that, is a hodgepodge of previous narratives, rehashed without any of the original charm or depth. The script feels like it was cobbled together in a rush, with dialogues that lack wit and often border on cringe-worthy.The character development, a cornerstone of the Spider-Man legacy, is woefully absent. Our beloved protagonist, usually a complex character balancing heroism with personal struggles, is reduced to a one-dimensional figure, swinging through the city in a series of over-the-top action sequences that feel more like a desperate plea for attention than a coherent part of the story.Special effects, typically a saving grace in such films, are surprisingly subpar. The overuse of CGI creates a disconnect, leaving the audience feeling more like they're watching a video game rather than a blockbuster movie. It's a visual overload that adds to the confusion rather than enhancing the experience.Even the acting, which one hopes might salvage some part of the film, falls flat. It's as if the weight of carrying a film devoid of substance has drained the cast of their usual charisma. Their performances, usually a highlight, are overshadowed by the film's overarching lack of originality and passion.In conclusion, this latest Spider-Man film is a disservice to the franchise. It's a clear example of a studio using a beloved name to draw audiences without putting in the effort to create something worthy of that name. For fans hoping to relive the magic of Spider-Man, this film is, regrettably, not the way to do it.",30 December 2023

",3,"Having hit a point of Marvel/Spidey fatigue after Endgame etc, I came to this one late and free of expectations. I can already see that the mask has started to slip, with more recent reviews dragging the rating down from its frankly ridiculous near-9 rating (somewhere between Raiders of the Lost Ark and Schindler's List apparently!). I rarely review, but it is my civic duty to contribute to the assertion of reality against the army of hype-victims who, like some zombie horde, overwhelmed this site with braindead 10-ratings on release.My focus here is an under-appreciated aspect of the awfulness of this movie, that is, the astonishing lack of psychological and intellectual realism that pervades the film.Let's start with the dramatic fulcrum around which the plot is built. Spidey wants himself, his gf and his bf to get into MIT soooo bad. Can you please bend the fabric of reality for me in humanity-endangering ways, Dr Strange? By which you mean brainwash the half-dozen admissions panelists at MIT to reconsider your applications? Why no! By which I mean brainwash the entire planet to forget they ever found out Spider Man was Peter Parker of course!Question. Why do you even go to study at MIT? Well, if you graduate with honours and you're lucky, you might wind up working in a first-class lab under a respected researcher, heck, give it a decade or two and you might even get to invent something! Er, correct me if I'm wrong, but has not Peter already invented military-grade technology (i.e. Web-slingers) in his basement? Has he not also got privileged access via Stark Industries to some of the most sophisticated technology not just in the world, but in the entire universe? Why on earth would he trade this in for a chance to get a third author credit under some douchebag who wouldn't know a Tesseract or a Pym Particle if it came up and bit him on the behind? Undergrad work at MIT is just so far beneath him at this point, you may as well have the plot revolve around a quest for a gold star on his high-school report card.But, you may say, he would still want his bf and gf to get into MIT. Would he though, really? How could someone who operates on a totally different plane to MIT researchers be anything other than mildly disdainful of the whole idea? Realistically, someone of Spidey's intellect would regard the prospect as at best a quaint waste of time. Let's be real here, no-one close to Spidey needs to get a job, ever, at this point. Not only is he in the Avengers (an organisation which I assume does not require its employees to hold down outside jobs to pay the bills), his web-slinger alone is Nobel-prize-level tech worth billions of dollars. And having hung out with Tony Stark for quite a while, it's not like Spidey would be scandalised by the idea of making money out of his inventions.Then of course there's the whole ""The Boys"" angle. That is, Spidey would have companies and media lining up to pay him megabucks for star turns all over the place. Which brings us to the second ridiculous conceit - his apparently universal unpopularity. This is so dumb you almost struggle to comprehend it. The guy is an Avenger ffs! He's also bff to modern-day Jesus, Tony Stark, not to mention a New York icon after a couple of years humanely stopping criminals in his spare time. There is no credible world in which, even with murder charges hanging over him, this guy is not a supremely bankable personality.The question is, does Spidey care about having a regular career? If yes, all of the above applies. If no, MIT is nothing more than a chance to play beer-pong and chug kegs for a couple of years. Either way, the deep concern for admission to three years of plodding undergraduate work makes absolutely zero sense.Dr Strange, of course, should know all this much better than we do. Again, he would regard such things as university degrees as faintly ridiculous adornments to someone who already has a semi-regular job saving the world/universe. He would also, one can reasonably assume, be more than a little leery about creating even a teeny-tiny risk of space-time collapse to get someone - anyone - into an undergrad course at college. But no, Strange has picked up the same stupid ball as Spidey and the rest of the world for the sake of driving the plot forward. After a 30-second consultation he's busy bending reality out of shape like a toddler with a tv aerial!Then of course there's Aunt May. After a ten-minute chat with Green Goblin, she's decided he's really a lovely guy who is just a little vulnerable and misunderstood. Let's all hang out! Shall we check him for bombs? I mean... last time Spidey saw the guy he was throwing around a bunch of bombs which seemed a little, er, explody... naah don't worry about it. As a result of this, when Aunt May is eventually blown up by one of said bombs, it is reeeally tough to overflow with empathy.Which brings us to Spidey's reaction to the inevitable Aunt May blowing-up. ""I'm sooo angry with that Green Goblin, I'm gonna kill him!"" Really? That is your take away? There's nothing like a bit of character growth, and this is nothing like a bit of character growth. Completely failing to compute the painfully obvious conclusion that this whole thing is a predictable outcome of Spidey's own gross stupidity, not once (""please bend reality to get me into college""), but twice (""rather than send these several super-villains back to their realities, I'm going to bring my non-super nearest and dearest on a fun day out with them""), Spidey at this point is the guy who sticks his head in the lion cage and gets angry when it comes out a little worse for wear.Speaking of which, let's talk about Andrew Garfield's Spidey (aka Spidey3) for a second. Garfield tells us that as a result of his tragedies, he ""stopped pulling his punches"", which we can safely say would mean those punches would start going right through the heads of most common-or-garden criminals. Does this seem like a guy who has been regularly brutally killing people for years now? The idea of a dark and dirty Spidey3 from a parallel universe was a great opportunity to set up a kind of angel/devil-on-shoulder dyad with Toby Maguire, one urging restraint on Spidey, while the other told him to go ahead and vent his spleen. But no, the years of savage violence have etched themselves on Spidey3 about as deeply as a wash-away crayon.Ultimately, we know what all this is for, it is to drive forward a fan-service plot that not only dredges up old Spidey incarnations, but also re-enacts the old Uncle Ben plotline, so conspicuous by its absence from the latest version. But boy, as psychological and intellectual sleight-of-hand goes, this one is about as subtle as a freight train.Right, I think that's probably more than enough (as a wise boy once said, ""stop, stop, he's already dead!""). I'm not even going to get into the outrageousness of the ""wipe all memories of Peter Parker"" conceit that wraps up the film in a nice neat little package. I mean hey, at least with that one you can say ""but magic though"". The super-powers, even the dumb ones, I can live with. It's the epic stupor-powers I cannot abide.",22 December 2023

",5,"Inarguably the most successful film of 2021, Spider-Man: No Way Home picks up exactly when the last film left off as Spider-Man's secret identity is finally revealed to the world. Peter Parker (Tom Holland) and his friends face backlash following J. Jonah Jameson's bombshell and so Parker seeks the help of Doctor Strange to make all of this mess go away.The concept was teased in prior sequel Far From Home but the Multiverse is finally confirmed to be real in this movie as Stephen Strange's (Benedict Cumberbatch) attempt to use a spell that would potentially fix Peter Parker's problem opens up a whole new can of worms including heroes and villains from other Multiverses turning up in our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man's... well, friendly neighborhood. This was set to be one of the biggest comic-book movie crossovers ever in the style of hit animated feature Into The Spider-Verse but, of course, live-action. Online speculation was non-stop during the entire journey leading up to this film's release with fans wondering which previous cast members of the franchise would turn up.The multi-cameo gimmick would no doubt be this film's biggest draw, but also its biggest challenge as a coherent plot would need to tie everything together well enough. Luckily, Marvel had thusfar handled this kind of juggling act rather well. Judging by the audience reaction to this movie, it appears that the gimmick in question was very much a crowdpleaser and understandably so: seeing some of your favorite characters from your favorite franchise return in a new movie played by a beloved cast is always a nice nostalgic treat. Especially if they're having as much fun as the likes of Jamie Foxx, Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina are having in this latest film.The film's opening is a promisingly intense look at the overwhelming media attention that Peter Parker and his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) are forced to deal with, along with the negative impact this has had on his friends' lives, which he blames himself for. Doctor Strange agrees to help by casting a spell that would make it so everyone would forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man. Unfortunately, Peter's demands for countless caveats compromises the spell which Strange is forced to contain.But the damage is already done as the spell has already started to mess with reality and opened up the door for some unsavory characters like Doc Ock (Alfred Molina), the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), Electro (Jamie Foxx), The Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) and The Lizard (Rhys Ifans). Spider-Man takes on these villains who are unknown to him but clashes with Doctor Strange when the latter suggests destroying the spell, thereby sending them all home, whether this means they'll be dead again or not.This is a fun, playful, setup and it certainly gives this movie a lot to work with, especially when other Spider-Men start appearing. Unfortunately, there's not much more to this film than fanservice and thinking about its story for more than a few seconds prompts a bunch of question marks. Some of the villains, we are told, have been transferred here just before they died, despite them looking either way older or completely different. Some of the character designs are improved while some are exactly the same or way worse. Apparently summoning ""Peter Parker"" through a spell only summons Peter Parkers who are also Spider-Man.Peter Parker is praised repeatedly for the choices he makes in the film despite everything obviously being a complete disaster. Villains can just be turned good and bad, on and off, like a light switch. J. Jonah Jameson is given a big reveal in the last movie but he's barely in this one (why not bring back the old J. J. J. And have him face his own grumpy self for some easy, worthy comic relief?). It's all very inconsistent and, frankly, rarely convincing.Still, there's enough here to make No Way Home an entertaining popcorn movie: the Doctor Strange vs Spider-Man fight sequence in the Mirror Universe is fantastic, the face off with Doc Ock is enjoyable, Jamie Foxx is a much better Electro this time around, Andrew Garfield nearly steals the show with a particularly endearing performance and it's just nice to see all these likable actors have a good time on screen.Once the reintroduction of Spidey's baddies is digested, however, the film fails to make the best use of its cast and plot as the macguffin (magic box) coupled with yet another final rooftop fight in the dark (see the ending of Spider-Man 3 meets the ending of The Amazing Spider-Man) lacks originality and rhythm. The overly jokey script is also a massive, unwelcome distraction as it makes many characters feel off and the constant flow of lame one-liners comes off as extremely forced.In the vein of the X-Men franchise's Days Of Future Past, this Spider-Man movie aims to mix different versions of the same series together in order to fix a few flaws that fans have been complaining about for a while, but also cash in on nostalgia and take the franchise in a new, unexpected direction. As a result of this very ambitious endeavor, parts of this work but a lot of it doesn't and, as much as it was nice to see some familiar faces here, less would 100% have been more.The script feels bloated and yet, at the same time, bare: Zendaya isn't given much to work with here character development-wise, while Ned (Jacob Batalon) overstays his welcome with a big role when this movie called for a cameo from him at the most. This translates into a strangely paced movie with its share of dull filler. The attempt to redo the Uncle Ben scene AGAIN, just slightly differently, is a complete misstep as the scene in question feels about as emotionally rewarding as the awful Sandman CG seen throughout this film.This movie throws a lot at you and, yes, some of it sticks. No doubt about it. But there's just too much fluff, too many heavy-handed references, too many inconsistencies and too much Whedonian corniness to make this a truly rewarding experience. You'll have fun with some of the action scenes, you'll enjoy seeing your fave villains/heroes on screen again but that's pretty much it. No Way Home has its moments but it remains a passably entertaining outing and the lesser film in the Tom Holland trilogy.Amusing yet uneven blockbuster.",28 November 2023

At other times though it largely plays it straight. The film uses a lot of what feels like long takes and it has quite a natural look and feel to it, it's not too polished and slick in other words. The makeup work on the zombies is pretty basic though some of the gore effects are really well done. This is a classic zombie movie of a few humans holding out against a huge host of zombies. There's some not so subtle shots at materialism like the biker gang breaking into the mall to steal jewellery, who cares about stuff like that when the worlds ending right? Again as so often while the zombies are the threat it's the humans who are the real villains in the story. I think a minor complaint about the main characters in the film is they're all kind of boring which I didn't think about Night of the Living Dead.

",8,"Watching A Clockwork Orange yet again after an interval of 20 or so years has met with yet another different analysis and appreciation of the film (of sorts). Its magnificent to look at visually and stylistically, even more so on this viewing, of that there was never any doubt, Kubrick being the craftsman he was. His interpretion of the novel and in filming it does however differ. The philosophical dilemma of moral choice is handled efficiently but through such a turgid filter of ugliness and constant pain that one has to question the director's true motives at the time and wonder if perhaps he reaped what he sowed in the emerging cinema of permissiveness, sex and violence. The monster he unleashed in 1971 was certainly to plague his later life with the same bad vibes that his anti-hero Alex suffered in the second half of the picture. Some claim ACO a masterpiece, I would say more a 'piece' ,undoubtedly an important film in the canon of cinema with many memorable and breathtaking sequences and images to savour. However, even after repeated viewings over the years, one such as myself find I simply can't get the bad taste out of my mouth after watching. Its a complex and dastardly beast to be sure and its lurid and polluted vision of the future might be seen as an exercise in cinematic exploitation by some or a prophetic vision of what was to become.

rw9450760,ur171880814,tt0066921," A must watch for people wanting to become part of the film industry
",10,"A Clockwork Orange is a masterpiece, the whole film is nothing like anything I have ever watched. For me personally I would say it was the second most shocking film I have ever seen the first is Come and see and the third is Beau is afraid. I think part of the reason I like it so much is because it is set in Britain although it is shot by an American director called Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick is my favourite director and I hope to be like him one day, I could talk about him for hours but we are here to review something else. The film has a running time of 2 hours and 16 minutes and was released in 1971 but set in the near future of Britain. The story follows a young boy called Alex DeLarge who he and his gang beat up and rape anyone they want but eventually he gets caught by the police who give him the choice to undergo a phycological procedure that rob him of all control of his actions, we see the horrors of experiments they commit on him and what life is like for him after he has been released. Alex is played by Malcolm McDowell who shows some of the best emotions I've ever seen by an actor before and basically tortured himself to when playing the character (As seen in the Ludovico technique). I'd like to comment on the year it was released, 1971 back then no one was used to this sort of movie and was without a doubt the most graphic movie of all time. What really amazes me though was the fact that people went to go watch this movie in cinema expecting only mild amounts of graphic content but in return got something much more gruesome I remember talking with my grandad about when he went to go the cinema to see it when it was released and when the movie was over the whole cinema was silent. I gotta say this movie is extremely messed up but I enjoyed it all the way through. As the film is set in the future music will have changed and so will language and slang. As the film was released in 1971 there isn't as much music as there was now but still a good bit and loads of popular groups, for example Alex loves Beethoven who is a famous composer and in the film popular music is Classical songs but with electronic twists with it. Alex is a particularly big fan of Beethovens 9th symphony 4th movement which unfortunately is played when he is undergoing treatment and cannot listen to Beethoven anymore we also see what happens if he does later in the film. The slang they use in the film is called Nadsat which is basically a combination of Russian that Alex and his gang of droogs use for example ""and sit like a horror show co-operative malchik"". The film has three famous scenes, the first is when Alex is at a milo bar and when he is drinking milk with his gang and the camera slowly zooms out. The second is when he is walking with his gang and Alex beats up two of his gang members and chucks them in the water and the third is when Alex is undergoing the horrors of the Ludovico technique. If you can handle a very graphic movie I would say it's well worth the watch as it's quite famous and different from other films.",22 November 2023

",8,"I'm old enough that I remember ""A Clockwork Orange"" being banned from any form of release in the UK and there's still a bit of an illicit charge about watching it today, even if the actual sex and violence in it is tamer than what you'd see on TV nowadays. I enjoyed this watch, my first in a few years, and felt the plot held up more than I remembered.Alex (Malcolm McDowell) and his gang rampage around in the evenings, indulging in whatever violent fantasy crosses their mind. Alex's gang resent him though and are quick to abandon him when a burglary goes wrong, and a woman dies. He's arrested and given a lengthy sentence. To commute the time, he agrees to an experimental procedure involving extreme aversion therapy. Though it succeeds, it leaves Alex ill-equipped to cope with the consequences of his former actions.This was the DVD version I was watching, that was released as part of the Kubrick collection back in 2000. It looks really good, which I think is perhaps more to do with Kubrick's style rather than specifically the print used for the DVD. There is still a power to the film, much of which is in the performance of McDowell. Alex is one of cinema's biggest monsters in the first half but, whilst he's too far gone for you to feel sorry about him, he's incredibly vulnerable in the second half.In my head, I always think of the film as being more like vignettes but it's a more complete and satisfying story, even missing the last chapter of the book, than I remembered it being.",18 November 2023

Alex and his Droogs get their nightly kicks through random acts of violence; they gang rape a woman while her crippled husband watches, they beat a bum within an inch of his life and even smash a lady's head with a giant penis sculpture. These hideous acts do not ruin the movie because they don't show the actual kill/rape and they're pretty much only part of the first half of the film. The second half follows Alex's rehabilitation where he is conditioned to become sick whenever tempted with sex or violence. This rehabilitation only backfires on Alex when he runs into his past victims and cannot fight back. Despite my above description this really is an amazing film; the acting is great, the cinematography is awesome and the story is very well told.

",5,"""A Clockwork Orange"" is based on the book by Anthony Burgess from 1962. It's a controversial story about a gang in a futuristic England and an ideological mess. This movie pretends to oppose society, Police and uses science to explain a right-wing fantasy about the loss of freedom and liberty. Instead, this movie celebrates the evil of its main character Alexander DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell)After the fantastic ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" Stanley Kubrick moves on to a distasteful picture a lot will find offensive and hard to watch. It's not for everyone, and the desensitizing images and the violent content will turn off most. Furthermore, this is not a film for kids by any means.Alexander DeLarge opens the movie with a voice-over while he and his friends (Droogs, as he calls them.) The camera pulls back on this sociopath, and he is drinking milk laced with drugs. His Droogs, Georgie (James Marcus), Dim (Warren Clarke) and Pete (Michael Tarn), sit with Alex deciding what to do for the night, and he refers to the drugs as ""Sharping you up for a bit of the old ultraviolence.""They run about the streets at night, commit violent acts, and take pleasure in causing severe harm to people. Alex and his friend beat a homeless man and beat the hell out of a rival gang of stupid hillbilly-looking idiots run by ""Fat stinking Billy Boy.""Alex is a misguided character who doesn't let anyone rise above him without consequences. He is a disturbed individual who seems to come off as some anti-hero but is nothing more than a sadistic rapist, and his character is the entertainment factor for the picture. We learn nothing about him other than that he loves violence and Beethoven. The truth is, the picture celebrates his terrible behaviour. It might seem like it's about mind control, but it's about how terrible Alex is.Eventually, their night of sin ends when the gang enters the house of a couple and beats the husband. After tapping his mouth, he is forced to watch his wife sexually assaulted by Alex. Not before he sings ""Singing in the Rain"" while kicking the husband to the song's tune. This man is essential to the story and has something to do with what happens to Alex near the end.Alex is visited by his probation officer PR Deltoid (Aubrey Morris), who knows how violent Alex is and is aware of what he does at night. There don't seem to be any intelligent characters in the picture. Alex seems to be able to fool everyone with his behaviour. We see a character that should be jailed for what he does, but nobody seems to rise above or be shaken by him. Mr. Deltoid is the only character that sees through Alex. He and Chief Officer Barnes (Michael Bates), the strict officer that Jails Alex in the second act.After Alex invades the mansion of a wealthy woman, he ends up hurting her, and his gang leaves him to rot for the Police after they expressed discontent with his petty crimes. Upon learning the woman has died, Alex is sentenced to 14 years in prison.The picture touches on morality and psychological conditioning. In the second act, Alex volunteers for the treatment to condition him and attempt to make him ""a good boy."" They hook him up to a chair, force his eyelids open with a speculum and drug him with something that induces nausea, paralysis, and fear. This therapy aims to make a patient severely sick when thinking about violence, thus ""curing"" them. Once Alex is released, he becomes incapable of fighting back and is robbed of his free will.So we have this ex-violent criminal who was jailed for violent crimes and has now been taken over by the government and left helpless. He has the tables turned on him, and the end of the picture leaves you wondering what happens. Does Alex pay for his crimes and get cured? It's hard to say. I don't think so, given the final camera shot. Alex is a clockwork orange - clockwork on the outside and mechanical on the inside.The imagery of the picture is dazzling, but celebrating a character such as Alex is appalling. I was left confused by the end of the film and the government officials apologizing to Alex. He has a smile on his face as if it was all a dream.Alex is violent because Kubrick wants him to be an entertainment factor. There's no creeping fascism when It's made to look like society created Alex and his gang. His parents are loving, he lives at home, and we have to watch Alex commit all the acts of violence just to smile at the end, saying, ""I was cured all right,"" because that is what Kubrick wants.5/10.",28 October 2023

This is a must see for any fans of horror cinema and if you haven't seen it yet, then what's stopping you.The plot = A group of survivors attempts to flee the chaos of the city amidst a zombie outbreak consisting of 2 SWAT team members Peter (Ken Foree) and Roger (Scott H. Reinger), a traffic reporter Stephen (David Emge) and his executive pregnant girlfriend Francine (Gaylen Ross) and seek refuge in a secluded shopping mall.George A. Romero replaces the 'Night of the Living Dead's claustrophobic setting and opts to expand the overall scope of the landscape by showing the full level of destruction, carnage, and chaos that the zombie apocalypse has caused and it's a breathtaking yet haunting sight to behold and creates an even more intense atmosphere with memorable set pieces including the shopping mall itself which is used to its fullest potential. The zombies themselves looks impressive for such a low budget film and are sometimes lacking, but the over-the-top gore effects are grisly yet effective with incredible make up and effects work done by Tom Savini who easily cranks this flick up to legendary status. This is one horror movie that you will never forget and includes all the things that you love about the genre. Thanks to Romero's masterful directing style you've got a simple yet engaging plot that's well paced with interesting characters that you instantly invest in and captures that feeling of living in a nightmarish world.The small cast here are amazing with great performances from each of the 4 players and are each given a decent amount of screen time to fully develop their roles. Ken Foree and Scott H. Reinger are both fantastic in their respective roles as the SWAT team members with Ken delivering an instantly cool badass character and Scott brining in an interesting and diverse quality in his unhinged character. Rounding off the cast are David Emge delivers a strong level-headed performance as the leading man and Gaylen Ross gives a strong turn as the female lead with both her and David make for a dynamic paring and brings some interesting drama to the movie.Overall 'Dawn of the Dead' is the absolute best when it comes to zombie flicks, a masterpiece that stands the test of time.",12 October 2023

Romero's portrayal of society on the brink of collapse is brilliant. The character development is great as you really get to know each main character and the idea of barricading a shopping mall is intelligent as well.Though humorous at times the film reinforces the message of it's predecessor Night of the Living Dead; that Mankind will be responsible for its own downfall because people are unable to get along and see eye to eye even if their own survival depends on it.Though cheesy by today's standards Savini's gore effects were top notch for their time including a zombie getting the top of it's head chopped off by a helicopter blade, numerous headshots and some of the most memorable zombies.A lot of people dismiss this classic because it's low budget and from the 70s but I thought it was an ultimate zombie epic.There are actually 3 different cuts of this film; The US Theatrical Version, The Extended Cut and the European Cut: Zombi. Zombi has a different soundtrack that eliminates the humor elements and social commentary in a few scenes but adds a few gore scenes as well. There are some great guitar solos during the shoot out with the bikers that make the scene much more intense. The downside is that they cut out the zombie's head in the helicopter scene. Soundtracks aside, I like the extended version the best because it tells more details about the story and has all the gore and action scenes.

Which does not come of as easy as ""they're coming to get you Barbara"" or even ""another one for the fire"". And yet the movie is a benchmark, it changed the landscape (which can be viewed as ironic or pun considering it mostly plays in a mall location wise) of horror movies.And to think he did not get the finance for it entirely in America ... had to go and take some money from Italy! Dario Argento - whatever you may think of him and his films, horror lovers have to thank him! If for the existence of this movie alone.Of course him being involved also gave him the right of cutting the movie any way he wanted to. And I will get into the many version of the movie that exist. But let's get back to Romero for a second. Even after the success of Night of the living Dead, it was hard for him to get money. And he didn't get any for Night ... a rights issue, the movie being considered public domain and the reason you may see clips of it in other movies - they do not have to pay anything for it.This takes the whole zombie thing to a whole new level. Not just on the social commentary side (consumerism, goals, dreams, group dynamic, psychological impacts and so forth ... many of those things quite ahead of time), but also on the effects side. Tom Savini - now considered as one of the best when it comes to make-up and special effects! And deservedly so - his friendship with Romero also led him to direct a remake of sorts of Night of the living dead in the 90s - to finally make some money for those involved, including Romero. And it had some nice tweaks and twists.Here he gets into it right from the start - blowing head and bites ... especially the bites ... really vivid imagery and something that some people may not be able to .. digest (sorry for the pun). In its heart it is an adventure though, it is commentary (see above) and it is a human story. With a lot of violence - now onto the different versions.Officially there are not that many. You have the ""Romero"" cut (aka theatrical cut), the Cannes cut, that had to be rushed to make it to the Festival and the buyers/sellers market .. and then you have the Argento cut. Argento making the movie leaner and meaner - so for those who are not looking for the ""comedy"" or commentary ... this would be the preferred cut ... also because it has music by Goblin .... really good music too. Still the ""mall"" music Romero used, makes more sense for the sensibility he was after.Having said that, there are a lot of other versions - in Germany there was even a Final Cut - which only meant they used the other versions and edited music or even put some slo-mo into certain scenes (especially the action scenes). The movie (Romero cut) is in the Museum of Modern Arts - which should tell you a lot ... that this is not just a horror movie! But a movie with depth ... and a movie that was done for little money and yet paid everyone their fair share.The eventual Remake was more an action movie - and as such did work. I would try not to compare the two movies. Zombies are slow walking for me - never was a fan of the running ones. Dead things do not run - period. Anyway funny seeing some people you may recognize from other Romero stuff, like Joe who is the main antagonist in Day of the Dead - he is in the Cannes cut .. and his character may just be the same we see in Day - before or after Dawn you ask? Well for you to find out.This being Review 10.305 and me loving number games ... can't wait to rewatch Day of the Dead in the near future and concluding the Trilogy of the Dead Romero created ... then reading the Comic book that was released by him (story by Romero at least) ... Empire of the Dead!

Its pretty fun to watch the characters fighting against the zombies and thinking of plans to barricade the mall. Also the mall is a great place to take shelter at because there's a bunch of supplies and even weapons in there. The movie also focus on social commentary on consumerism on how the zombies are like brainwashed consumers coming to the mall to buy stuff and to hangout. Later in the movie we see how the zombies aren't the biggest danger during the outbreak and I really like the action scenes during it.The movie also have some comedy to it with the characters having fun at the mall and the goof activities that happened during the raid scene.,7 September 2023

The cinematography, acting, script, and plot kept me rooted to my spot, hoping against hope for a safe outcome for the hero of this story.What I loved about this tale is the way they portrayed this soldier, Vikram Batra; a man who chose to live life in the moment with an extreme amount of courage - whether it was confronting a young women with his feelings, marrying her on the spot during and R&R, standing up for himself against neighborhood bullies, or giving all the life he had during battle. Every stereotype I've not realized I've maintained in my head about soldiers was uprooted and broken (the rules-oriented to a tee, flat affect, withholding emotions, and etc. Type of stereotype).Turns out true courage comes from not wasting a moment of life, making friends with all you deem worthy, spending time to care about acquaintances, taking simple and pure joy when life offers it, sharing that joy with others, and respecting oneself and other.This film has provided me with much food for thought and I will be looking into this moment in history further.",10 December 2023

With never-ending tension going between India and Pakistan, so many sacrifices are being made by our Indian soldiers whose duty is to save the citizen from the scum of the Earth. To honor the soldiers who have laid down their lives to serve the country, there are few movies being made to tell the stories of gallantry. One such movie is on the Vikram Batra biopic drama, Shershaah, which stars Sidharth Malhotra and Kiara Advani.Shershaah chronicles the life and story of the brave soldiers Vikram Batra (played by Sidharth Malhotra) who led a very difficult operation in Kargil War against Pakistan and even managed to pull down the enemy soldiers in hand combat, ensuring a solid victory for our motherland.Directed by Vishnu Vardhan, Shershaah is one such film which will keep you engaged right from the beginning till the electrifying climax. The powerful true story of Vikram Batra along with other soldiers who have sacrificed and struggled to ensure that safety of Indian citizen is their top most priority, The makers have done a fabulous job in portraying the stress, blood and sweat displayed by our honorable soldiers. Couple of scenes did caught my attention - Pakistani missiles hitting the Indian base in a surprise attack, the action scene at the police check point and last but not the least, the final showdown - which is the climax scene showing the ultimate sacrifice by Vikram Batra when he exposes himself to the enemy fire trying to drag the injured soldier to safety, and in the process was shot. We get to see the real heroes only through some newspaper articles or social media who fought for their country, sacrificed their family and could not even return back to their motherland. Thanks to films like Shershaah speaks the true events of making of a soldier and the hardship and struggle these war machines go through.The initial reels had romantic track showing how Vikram Batra meets his fiancee Dimple hampers the momentum of the biopic drama, though the chemistry between Sidharth Malhotra and Kiara Advani is sparkling. Also, it is high time, Bollywood can start making biopics without songs and melodrama which sometimes play the spoilsports. Nevertheless, writing by Sandeep Shrivastava is brilliant which should be lauded. Technically, Shershaah boast off brilliant cinematography capturing the beautiful locales of Kashmir and Ladakh. Art direction is mind-blowing while background score creates more tensionTalking about performance, Sidharth Malhotra essays the role of Vikram Batra with T. The actor successfully shows diverse expressions of Vikram Batra right from the beginning when he joins the Indian Army as a rookie to the gallant soldier who fights for his country till his last breath. Shershaah might be a turning point in Sidharth Malhotra's career who comes up with a brave performance. In the supporting role, Kiara Advani, Shiv Pandit and Nikitin Dheer have acted their part with equal justice.So overall, Shershaah is a spellbinding tale of a brave soldier which should be lauded and appreciated for its genuine attempt.

Now, this was visually good, colour sequences were nice, musical score was good, however 2.5 hours for all that is insanely boring and just plain torture at times! At the 1 hour 10 minute mark, you have a scene of the astronaut go out into space, then for 6 and a half minutes there is just what can only be described as the sound of a pressure cooker whistling constantly! After 3 minutes of this I almost wanted to poke sharp instruments into my ears to stop that sound from making my brain feel like was about to explode! The movie is just filled with endless silence, or repetitive sounds that for the most part were just annoying after 10 to 15 seconds, funny enough, some of these irritating sounds caused my dogs to react and start looking around and have to leave the area. Dialogue is very minimal through entire movie, instead this movie is just filled with instrumental musical score in all the spots not in silence or with annoying sounds.Then the plot is not really clear, besides a computer named Hal being evil all for the mission, which at that point it turns on the 2 astronauts, not sure if the attempt was to be comedic, or just ended up being like that, but Hal starts to tell the astronaut he is better now, and to please talk to him, (at least it cracked a smile from me).One of the worst movies I have ever saw, and frustrating that is so highly rated and so many people spewing out comments of how brilliant of a movie this is!

It is a famous movie that a lot of people recommended to me, and I heard about it for the first time when the movie Barbie was released this summer, because the first scene takes inspiration from A Space Odyssey.To start with, I want to expose the few things I did not enjoy in the movie. First, the length. Even though it is very common for old movies to last long, I think that making it last two hours and a half was not necessary. According to me, there is not a lot happening in the movie, and the scenes were too long, making the beginning of the movie hard to watch.Apart from the previous point, there are elements from the movie I enjoyed. To begin with, I liked the fact that it is confusing. It is quite strange and hard to understand, yes, but I like that it gives us freedom of interpretation. For example, the giant baby at the end, after the main character, Dave, dies. I understood it as a reincarnation, the re-birth of Dave, into a divine force after he discovers the truth of the Universe after traveling across it.Moreover, I enjoyed the aesthetic aspect of the movie. I think it is always pleasant to see symmetrical shots, it gives a sense of order and organization, making it pleasant to the eye. Also, the colors and the setting were harmonious as much as futuristic, such as the all whites rooms with red furniture. And talking about the setting, I particularly enjoyed one the last shots, the one in the room, because the ambiguous gap between the classical furniture and the modern floor made the atmosphere of the room uncomfortably good, because it is not common to see a room as this one.And last but not least, the fact that the movie was released in 1968 and that it is a futuristic vision of our world -of 2001 more precisely- is quite intriguing, because we now know how technology has advanced, hence we can put into perspective the two visions: the one from the past and the one from now.To conclude, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a movie I would highly recommend if you enjoy science-fiction and movies based on space, but also if you like movies that can be interpreted in various ways.",8 December 2023

But, I'm equally in agreeance with those who say overrated, boring, and what the bleep. I'd most certainly have to agree with the last 20 minutes or so for the very open to interpretation ending. I have to believe acid was a factor.I commend the science of the film, and the effects for a film from 1968. The colour is also great.

",8,"2001: Space Odyssey was not as tedious as I thought it would be. Because I am not interested in the topic of space and its conquest, I thought I would get bored very easily and it was not the case.The beginning of the movie with great apes was a great material to analyze and interpret the message behind it. The end of the opening scene with the discover of violence and how it can be used was an enthralling way of making a parallel with the progress of technology in the scene after.The movie is divided in 4: like they said the ""Dawn of Man"" with the apes, the Mission on the Moon, the mission on Jupiter and, lastly the ""Re-birth"". My favorite part was definitely the mission on Jupiter and the ending (Re-birth).Dawn of Man, as much as intriguing it was to question the direction the plot would take, the scenes were long and even though they were a lot of different shots and angles that created dynamism, nothing was really happening so it lost my attention at one point.I feel like because it was such a topic of discussion in 1968 but not now in 2023, it was my least favorite part. The shots were beautiful, seeing it in a theater made it even better, the music was immersive, it almost felt like a dream. Sadly, the plot did not catch my attention, the sound was low quality (probably because of the movie theater I was in) and it was about space and the whole conquest which, again, I'm not interested in.My favorite part was the Mission on Jupiter: it had everything it needed to captivate me. First, I loved the acting of Keir Dullea, he was such a great actor during the scene were he's in distressed, I started to feel like him. Eve though there were shots of space and the satellite just like in the second part, it did not feel as boring because they were shorter. My favorite segment of the plot was the opposition between the character and Hal as I feel like it's a topic that is now discussed within our society (with ChatGPT for instance). Also, it was more thrilling and I was more invested in this part of the plot.As for the ending, even though I am not 100% sure of the significance, it felt right and the perfect way to end this movie. The sequence of what I think was a black hole was amazing and I did not expect this.My interpretation of the movie, and more importantly the monolith, was to focus on our advances in history and how our greediness could turn them into something dangerous for us. The first part with our dawn makes it obvious: because apes found out bones could be used as weapons, we started to use violence. But, as for the Mission on moon, to me it felt like it was trying to stop us from going further, but as we know they didn't in the movie which continued with the Mission on Jupiter. In this segment, the monolith represented the danger of technology such as artificial intelligence and how we could not trust them 100%.Overall, I was surprised by the movie and how invested I was. I would not recommend watching it at home, it's an experience you should have in a theater to make it completely immersive. And honestly, I would recommend it to anyone because even I, ended up liking it despite a few things that I talked about.",7 December 2023

In fact, it feels as though we are invited to marvel at how well those differently abled are allowed to live; observe the scene where the man who is a quadruple amputee lights a cigarette, and the ease with which the ""half boy"" gets around. The ""normal"" people are the outsiders, and the bad guys, whose exploitation of the little people turns psychopathic when they realise how much money might be involved.The final, amazing end sequence, with the performers gathering in a rain storm for revenge, was unfortunately cut in the version I saw, but the final shot of what happens to the villainess is still shocking, as is much of the material, all the more so because you know what you're seeing is real. This is no CGI or animatronic fest, it's a movie from 1932.I say take the risk and check it out. There's no other experience like it in the movies.

rw8561234,ur1964495,tt0022913," It's extraordinary. But why?
",8,"This really is a remarkable film in so many ways. It boasts more robust diversity than a lot of movies can claim even 90 years later, and to some degree comes across as an active refutation of conventional norms and values that place utmost importance on ideals of physical beauty. Very notably, there's not one real trace of judgment cast on the sideshow performers featured here, a far cry from other titles - contemporary or modern - that consciously or not exhibit ugly biases and glorify harmful behavior. Of course this is a sharp contrast even to how the cast were apparently treated during production, and how the world greeted the feature upon release, but this again only goes to show how gratifyingly forward-thinking Tod Browning was, as a filmmaker and as a person. Even without especially looking to the narrative content, one can only lament that 'Freaks' as it exists is literally a fraction of the picture Browning made, because one must imagine the original vision would be even more rich.That the movie was thusly chopped up does rather seem to come across. For, in these 64 minutes, a majority of the length mostly feels like a fictionalized ""day in the life"" portraiture of the performers, with all the drama of their comings, goings, and interpersonal relationships. There is definite plot, of course, centered around Cleopatra, but it's relegated to a rather small fragment of the already abbreviated runtime, and develops slowly right up until the last 15 minutes or so, feeling increasingly rushed as the climax rolls around. True, this isn't terribly abnormal for features of the 30s - I've seen more than a few that struggled with the same approach to storytelling - and at least this one has the benefit of additional social and cultural themes and worth to pick up the slack, but the issue is notable all the same. And to that point, while the narrative is familiar but written well such as it is, if not for the unique setting and cast then this probably never would have registered on anyone's radar in the first place. It's a very odd set of circumstances 'Freaks' finds itself in.This is otherwise very well made, with excellent production values that still hold up, and terrific contributions from everyone in the cast that let the whole affair look real and believable. Finely executed as everything is, the climax is most immediately grabbing as it serves up genuine thrills and minor chills. It's significant to note that conversation surroundings the film in no small part revolves around its long-standing label as ""horror"" - and for anyone watching 'Freaks' on that basis, the superb climax is where you'll get recognizable genre content. On the other hand, the question of what constitutes ""horror,"" and how it applies to this title, is just as substantial a topic as any of the other musings previously noted, and the only difference is that this one does specifically speak to the content. It's worth reflecting that the real ""horror"" about 'Freaks' may be in the very realist, meta, and tragic sense of how the sideshow performers are treated by the other carnival folk; the disapproving stare the film gives audiences as it knows many viewers will react poorly to visualization of extraordinary individuals; and the unspoken truth that people like the performers (and many others who have less readily distinguished disabilities, or who buck any sensibility of conformity or ""normalcy"") have been and will continue to be persecuted, harmed, and killed just for existing.All this is to say: 'Freaks' is indisputably a good, special movie. Whether or not it's a ""great"" and very smart movie may depend on how much of the subsequent analysis (particularly in regards to the inquiry of ""horror"") was built into it by Browning. And whatever the case may be, there's also this: why 'Freaks' is enjoyable, and all other points of very worthy discussion, overshadow the actual narrative content. That's no fault of the filmmaker or anyone else involved (except perhaps the studio who reduced the feature to its extant length), but regardless, that the movie itself can be thusly overshadowed by anything is revealing of the problems it faces, and the peculiar situation it's in as a piece of cinema.Ultimately 'Freaks' is an iconic picture, and one very well worth watching.

Directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj, this Tamil-language film is a masterful blend of suspense, drama, and raw emotion that showcases Karthi's immense talent as an actor.The film follows the journey of a recently released convict, Dilli, who finds himself unwittingly caught up in a dangerous drug trafficking ring. With no one to turn to for help, Dilli must rely on his wits and cunning to survive the night and protect the lives of those he holds dear.Karthi's performance in the lead role is nothing short of phenomenal. He brings a raw intensity and emotional depth to the character of Dilli, making the audience feel every ounce of his pain, fear, and determination. The supporting cast, including Narain, George Maryan, and Dheena, also deliver standout performances that help to elevate the film to new heights.What makes ""Kaithi"" truly exceptional, however, is its masterful direction and stunning cinematography. Lokesh Kanagaraj's deft hand behind the camera creates a palpable sense of tension and urgency that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats from start to finish. The film's use of light and shadow is particularly striking, creating a haunting atmosphere that perfectly complements the story's darker themes.Overall, Karthi's ""Kaithi"" is a must-see film for fans of high-octane action and gripping drama.

The first half most of the movie was hard to follow, dye to getting so many new characters too quickly, and the first half at least to me was pretty difficult to follow, it's like the first half was the introduction to all of the characters that live in this circus. We meet our midgets and the male one is in love with a beautiful lady, that is just evil, and ready to manipulate him. It was first a joke, she was messing around with him, while she had her true macho boyfriend in the background that she hid from him. The second half is when the female midget goes out of her way to tell the lady to stop, and somehow goes out of her way to say that he is rich. The lady then decides to marry the male midget, in order to kill him and get all of his richness. Also, throughout of the movie, we can see the macho constantly making fun of the different people, and the whole movie is just a message, to who the real freaks are? See, from one angle we see these different people to be different, and we classify them differently and downgrade them. While the ""regular"" people, look regular, but there are actually the freaks, because they are the ones that are capable of breaking a midget's heart, and to the point of killing him, just for personal gain. This movie is in the same boat as Cannibal Holocaust, as in who is really in the wrong here? I am not going to spoiler the ending, but it's awesome and depressing at the same time. Also ill be completely honest, i think this movie is away of it's time. Because to this day i am positive that different people keep being treated bad by the rest of society, i am sure that that did not change a lot. Since people will judge just because over your skin tone, religion and such, i am positive that being different is in the same boat. I am confused to why this movie is considered to be disturbing or horrific, it's a tragic, love movie that does it's job pretty well.

",7,"This is a very progressive film, especially when you consider the state of medicine and public attitude toward disabled people of the time.The horror of the film is in how the ""freaks"" are treated and the social hierarchy they were oppressed under, along with the code of ethics that arises from their mistreatment by society. It isn't really ""scary"" in the same way that Tod Browning's Dracula (1931) or other conventional horror films are. Instead we are subjected to the horrors of ridicule and oppression faced by people who were born different from what we think of as conventionally normal.The wedding table scene is of course famous as I recognized the chant instantly but had no idea where I had heard it before. Cleopatra being terrified of becoming one of them is an apt metaphor for how the privileged feel toward the less fortunate.However, this film is very dated technically. I could barely understand the dialogue and I am a guy that refuses to use subtitles for English language films if I can help it. Where I was more forgiving of Dracula for the sound, I cannot do the same here. It doesn't sound like Tod Browning tried to improve this aspect of the film and this was made a year later and after other films were made that sounded a lot better. My knowledge of 1930's films is pretty lacking but there's no way they had this much trouble with sound recording in all the works from 1932. The sound is so lacking that I am not sure if I'll watch this film again in the future. It isn't awful but it isn't good either.I am a big fan of the social commentary but I wish I could decipher more than half of the dialogue.",8 May 2022

Freak's was just that, a fresh idea with a huge message. Are normal people the freak's with greedy souls or are the deformed people. What drew me in was the base of the movie and the message it told. A beautiful but cold woman wins the heart of a short guy and uses him for her own greed.Though this movie was edited down to soften the movie it still was powerful. I felt for the deformed people because they were the ones who suffers the most from the nasty remarks during each show. Olga Baclanova (Cleopatra) steals the movie as the cold hearted vamp. Harry and Daisy Earles as the little people were just as powerful as Hans and Freda.I would love to see the full movie if it ever happens or if the lost footage is ever found. Tod Browning was hired to make a movie more scarier than ""Frankenstein"" but what he created was far more interesting than a horror movie. What he created was a movie about revenge being a dish served cold and was I thought careful not to exploit the wrong people. Even after 90 years this movie still packs that punch.

rw9539864,ur101462181,tt0457430," Pan's Labyrinth: a faerie tale for everyone and for no one
",5,"I bought 'Pan's Labyrinth' on DVD at a now torn-down Wal-Mart in 02006. I had seen the trailer for it
on TV & for some reason was intrigued enough to want to see it. I don't remember if it screened much here in Canada, being a Spanish film.I watched it a few times, & I couldn't even really say if I liked it then.Although it may have been better to have sold it or donated it to a library, I ended up dropping the disc
in the garbage a few years later.Why would I do that?As my title says, I think 'Pan's Labyrinth' is a movie for everybody & yet for nobody.I'm actually astounded that IMDb users have collectively rated it as highly as it is.A consistent atmosphere of death, sadness, and general dread hangs through almost every scene. It is supposed to be a fantasy story, but the magic element of the adventure Ophelia was set on by Pan is mostly outweighed by the viewer's dread of Captain Vidal. I believe that his role as antagonist ought to have developed more gradually throughout the film. The way he was portrayed made the movie like an overly spicy dish that could have been more enjoyable if the diner's tastebuds weren't made numb by the seasoning. Overall, the story features almost no character development, giving the audience nothing to celebrate.The magical tasks given to Ophelia by Pan are nonsensical, even by faerie tale standards, and have no
clear value from the audience's perspective, leaving them in the position of a clueless observer rather
than a participant in the adventure. The dining table monster Ophelia encounters, although unsettling, appears to be channelling an ersatz version of the Alien (1979) Xenomorph, but not anywhere near as formidable.I also didn't care for the black-and-white dichotomy in how the movie portrays the two sides in the Spanish Civil War, with the callousness and explosiveness of Vidal representing the Nationalist side, and the kindness and patience of Mercedes and the doctor representing the communist - uh, I mean, Republican - side. As simplistic as it sounds, wars are made possible by people who show up to support it. The Spanish Civil War was made possible by the Axis, Western Allies, and the Soviet Union; the war literally would not have happened if each side wasn't goading its proxy fighters on. Plus, as in every violent conflict around the world, there is no one absolutely good or absolutely evil side. I understand that this movie isn't a war movie or a political movie and it takes place entirely within a relatively confined area. But I still didn't care for the story's lack of appreciation for the bigger picture. Maybe I'm just not cut out for movies in which the main character is a young girl without any understanding of these nuances.Although it may be just more a cultural thing than anything to do with the filmmaking, I was also annoyed by the seeming inability of the characters to speak above a whisper. Why do they almost always speak as though they're in a nursery trying to avoid waking a baby? It's not that I'm a yeller or hard-of-hearing, but perhaps in Spain they don't value projecting one's voice as a sign of strong character.The reason why I generously give 'Pan's Labyrinth' even a 5/10 is because I still think amidst its
many flaws, there is a good moral to the story about the delicateness and preciousness of life.Not to mention, the female characters are all played by pretty ladies, and they make this movie almost
worth watching.",3 January 2024

The world outside of Vidal's mill is teeming with magical creatures, and also republican soldiers. The point here is that the woods - nature - are out of Vidal's control.The power Vidal wields is brutal and absolute, but only within the confines of the mill.

This could be up there with some of the best looking films I've seen, The way the woods alone is shot with so much colour and light is wonderful, its like you can see and feel the beams of light, the pollen in the air. The film follows heavy themes of death, life, fascism, obedience and disobedience, as well as fantasy v reality. The casting, acting, camerawork and editing is fantastic. Rather than having monsters as a metaphor for humans or fascists in this the fascists literally are the monsters and the fantasy monsters are more imaginary than real perhaps. At night the creaky old house we find ourselves in seems to come to life with magic and noises. The plot involves a girl brought to a house in the woods by her mother, pregnant and unwell with her new stepfather, a captain in the Spanish army trying to defeat partisans in the area who he suspects locals may be aiding. The film's cinematography deserves huge praise, the way the camera moves and spins and glides through the locations in a way which might normally annoy me but absolutely works in this genera. The film has some very heavy violence, swearing, scenes of torture, it's not a film for children to be clear. The step father is a complete pig, there's no attempt really to soften his character, he's obsessed with simply ruthlessly destroying his enemies and making sure he has a son, everything is just a means to an end. That's not to say he's not an interesting or complicated character though, you spend a lot of time with him in the film and the acting is all round excellent, especially from such a young talent playing the lead. Scenes in the rain somehow look even more dazzling than in the sun, while the film has a very strong sense of fear and distress to it the ending felt slightly forced though with a few things happening I didn't quite believe even though our main antagonist describes pride as being his weakness, characters happen to be exactly where they are needed to be when it suits the story, otherwise though it's a really excellent film.",25 December 2023

At 18 years old as of this review, it feels even more relevant than when it came out.Obviously it is not a fairy tale movie but it is a movie about a girl who imagines things to explain real world events around her. Very much how abuse victims cope with their situations sometimes.The beauty of this, is that if you are not paying attention you will miss that and consider this to be alice in wonderland type story. Magical portals, alternate dimmensions and all that wizard of oz happy tales. None of that here in reality. We never leave the mountain military camp. We never go exploring other dimensions. We are stuck in the same horrible place next to our dying mother and monster of a stepfather. The monsters in our head are him, others around him, the world we go visit is the war torn spanish mountain side we have been sent to. What Ofelia sees is some twisted mental picture of the world and events around her that she cannot really make sense of. We see a girl on adventure, yet it is a story of a girl in distress dealing with evil while trying to find good. I could tie in the dream characters with their euphemism equals but I am sure somebody has already done this in depth.Pan Labyrinth is so well done that if you really wanted to you will see the face value alice in wonderland movie. If you are an adult and you paid attention you will see this for what it is. And that is beautiful. When you have a movie that deals with death and nasty real life yet can be equally watched as a magical story detached from reality, you know it is a good movie.I gave it decent thought about what i can complain about, and nothing of substance came up. Sure, it can be a little mundane here and there, i would have liked more backstory of the mom and daughter. I understand it is war and times are tough but ending up with Vidal plays the oblivious mother angle a little too hard. I also would have liked more scope of time outside the dream world. There is difficulty piecing and correlating the timings of the dreams with the real world. We know in real world several months pass total, maybe even a full year, but it gets washed out quite a bit in practice. The dream sequences come and go and while they are attached to specific events, that is not always the case. It felt to me the real world time span vs the dream world span to be too asymmetrical. Sure screen time is half and half but story time i would have to say is 1:20 or even more. The dream state feels very compressed, it feels like the events there take place over 2-3 days total. That would be my contention subject.Regardless, on the whole it is executed near perfectly and it is a movie that will make you remember it. 20 year down the road, you will still remember it. I love that Ofelia dies. It is often a big taboo to kill kids in movies, but here, it is done within character making the subsequent death of Vidal so much more memorable. There is no duality, there is just solid consistent development that lasts until everybody is dead or not at the very end. The path taken from the start of the story is the path they end on. The deaths drive in the emotional in and solidify it as a movie that was not afraid of doing things to stay true to the story it wanted to tell.Imagine, Vidal gives up on the rebels, becomes a loving step father to Ofelia, cherishes his new son and they all live happily ever after the war (which will end soon anyway). Imagine. Would that be better? Absolutely not. And Del Torro stays true from start to finish. I applaud him for that.",12 December 2023

I think I might be a bit sick of fairy-tale subversions after Shrek and Disenchantment but I am hungry for another ""Blood Tea and Red String"".I beat into us that it is a ""dark fairytale"" and less obviously it is cast against the stark backdrop of a period drama of our world.Fiercely evocative of a time and place, the iron grip of fascism not quite squeezing fully over those resist for the dignity of the common person, all the points come through clearly but it counts for little since this is not really the movie I signed up for.Like a lot of movies recently, this feels a lot like 2 movies slammed into one. It takes a long time for this Video-game-esque ""do stuff for me, nina!"" story to converge meaningfully with the resist-the-bully story and to be honest they never really do. They simply juxtapose. The fairy tale isn't really that dark except maybe here and there. It's the war stuff that's dark but quickly it becomes apparent that it is all quite painfully generic. Generic fairy-tale plus a generic war-rebel story with the only edge being that we get these two together to distract from each other.There isn't really a substance or a theme or at least none common to both facets. At times one wonders that it might be a rumination about how in a world where evil and malice or reality, we find more and more need of nursery-tales.This sentimentality doesn't really fly though.The movies strength lies in its most superficial aspects. The design and realization is very charming and its earthy yet vibrant color scheme works swimmingly with its period color and its fabulous creations. The make-up and CGI has mostly aged very well (though that Frog most certainly has not!)We open with a narration about a princess and the ending is somewhat open to interpretation but if you do not give them a basic benefit of the doubt, then it is profoundly insulting. A lot of the writing feels contrived around making the best moments. At one point I'm thinking ""WHY didn't she just such and such"" and then we learn ""oh...so they can have this cool moment later"".A movie far less nuanced than it thinks it is and not terribly engaging. A delightful child at its centre is a selling point but its overall an admirable attempt that just doesn't come together well at all.I think it just cornered a market and its following is nothing more than that a few good posters.",1 December 2023

Despite this, ""North by Northwest"" does not surprise with anything other Hitchcock films, but we have a great technical setting and a very attractive script.

The effects and cinematography, given the film's release in 1959, demonstrate Hitchcock's mastery of visual storytelling, with the famous crop-dusting sequence and the climactic chase atop Mount Rushmore standing out as examples of tension-building through skillful camerawork. Nevertheless, contemporary audiences might find the effects somewhat dated, particularly when compared to modern standards. The engagement factor remains high due to the fast-paced plot, witty dialogue, and suspenseful set pieces, though the film's length and slower moments might test the patience of some modern viewers.

rw9533418,ur95140344,tt0063350," A classic chiller
",9,"A ragtag group of Pennsylvanians barricade themselves in an old farmhouse to remain safe from a horde of flesh-eating ghouls that are ravaging the Northeast of the United States.There are very few old-timey horror movies from the 50-60's that have managed to remain as scary for me without feeling like they were better as a byproduct of their time to where it's lost its effectiveness nowadays, but George A. Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" is one such exception in my books. Not that it doesn't show its age at all, but it was also pretty low budget, and for the 60's, so I can be a little more forgiving of its occasional shortcomings. But as such, it shows a lot of ingenuity and is extremely polished in very practical ways. So instead, let me tell you what Night of the Living Dead actually has going for it on such a said low budget.For starters, it was George A. Romero's directorial debut. Not that many filmmakers can claim such a classic starting achievement, but I'd think this is the kind of film debut many directors can only dream of (horror or not). Romero's eye for this film is confident, assured, crisp and tense. The film wastes no time getting right into the action (not a moment or line is wasted) which consistently rises until its devastating climax. Also the intentional decision to shoot this movie in black-and-white footage was a stroke of genius that really enhances the film's eerie and atmospheric tone and gives it a dreadful sense of conviction, as well as lending the outrageous tale a documentary feel. The film's action, which is set mostly within a farmhouse, provides an ideally confined atmosphere that keeps the tension engaging.I was surprised to find out that the film was actually met with a lot of controversy at the time of its release such as its graphic nature, character representation, and nihilistic ending (thankfully devoid of a traditional Hollywood happy ending). But I personally think these controversies work all the better for the movie, even more so nowadays, because it really challenged traditional conventions of horror films for its time and even nowadays, and I think it really subverted expectations for horror movies overall in all the best kinds of ways. I like horror movies that take things to the next level. In the case of Night of the Living Dead, violence. Of course there have been far more graphic zombie/horror movies since, but it really pushed the envelope of this area on screen here for its time. I absolutely love the character dynamics in this movie with its sly political undercurrent to them. This film put a black man in a house with all white people and made him the hero at a time when African American representation in film wasn't as inclusive (and especially during the Civil Rights movement), blowing up the butler stereotype and the incipient cliché of a horror film where the expendable black character dies first.Casting a black actor during this time made every bit of conflict between the forceful and strong willed protagonist Ben who is excellently played by Duane Jones, and the other survivors, especially the white beta male, Harry (Karl Hardman, also a co-producer), more racially charged. Yet the movie's racial dynamics go unspoken in the script. It's all in the subtext. The movie also gets some great mileage out of the supporting likes of Judith O'Dea's emotionally distressed Barbara and Keith Wayne and Judith Ridley's warm presence as young lovers Tom and Judy, too. Kudos are no less deserved to the extras playing the ghouls/zombies who give such embodied performances that hold up expertly 50 plus years on.""But how is Night of the Living Dead still scary for today?"" you may ask. Well for one, it's a film that's more about what is felt rather than what is shown. In addition to being so generally masterfully crafted, its sense of isolation and claustrophobia brought on by the farmhouse setting is quite distressful. The film expertly balances out character drama with monster violence with more of an emphasis on the former, which I think is a real treat, because it offers a fresh perspective to the horror that is so seldom explored in the genre nowadays, where it's more sensory than blatant. And although the ghoul's appearance was probably more realistically due to budget constraints, it seems to me that the fact that they look decidedly, frighteningly human is no coincidence. Could Night of the Living Dead have been suggesting mindless conformity or the dehumanization of modern life more than just a reflection of the fear of death and the unknown? Also, I believe there's an undercurrent to the protagonist's fate that is brilliantly reflective of societal prejudice, rather than the zombies' carnivorous appetites. Thus, I think the film is suggesting that reality can be as brutal and shocking as any nightmare alternative in celluloid could, too.On the surface, Night of the Living Dead might seem like a quaint production nowadays, from its almost nonexistent character development, it's less than polished editing and sfx. I also think it's worth noting that those who are used to, or prefer more action and quicker pacing may be left feeling underwhelmed with the picture. But in retrospect, these feel like minor gripes than they actually do complaints which isn't too fair to what a great production this is otherwise on a measly 114,000 dollar budget. Because in fact, even its ""flaws"" work for it, by Romero simply making the most of what he had to work with. Also I understand that for the 60's, character development was much less of a problem than people would see it nowadays, because as a horror movie, I'd imagine society then wanted to look no further than a good scare. And the movie certainly offers it, and then some, but not without effective character performances in and of their own right, and especially for the genre. It's ironic, because part of me actually wants to dismiss this as a B-movie, however easy or popular it may seem to do so now. But I can't bring myself to, because it wastes no time by being so simple yet so effective, and it's stylishly shot and so expressionist beyond a singular level that by the end and at the literal end, I feel such a bouncing high wire of emotions between feeling entertained, shocked, and even a little depressed. Whether or not this will go down in the annals of cinematic history as the best zombie movie or not (I think it is), one can appreciate that it was the trendsetter, and for very good reason that passes as both a horror and quite possibly cinematic classic in general with flying colors.9.0/10.",31 December 2023

I think this is a good balance, personally, I think the former is realistic horror cinema while the latter is just cheap and ugly.Night of the Living Dead isn't something I rewatch every year or watch for fun, I don't find it cozy. That's actually a testament to its darkness and power after 55 years. I mean the first twenty minutes or so have that nice spooky feel with atmospheric aesthetic touches in the pristine historical country home. But once all of the characters come on stage, so to speak, it's a slog through the suffering of humanity.Harry is atrocious, really the epitome of obnoxious conservative old man. It's a timeless trope, Harry is as real in our decade as it was in the 60s, unfortunately. I feel Ben's rage and disgust at this abusive white man. He's not just racist, he's sexist, bigoted and self-righteous in every possible way. His wife, Helen, fights back as best she can but you can tell she's just wore out from being married to this overbearing brute and possibly afraid that if she talks back too frequently he'll hit her.Barbara is a real drag in her learned helplessness, locked in a passive childlike state by her social conditioning as a privileged white woman of the upper or upper middle class who is only expected to marry a wealthy man and not much else. All of her life skills consist of pedantic repetitions or motherly nagging, and abandon her entirely when her brother is killed. While we might sympathize that this might wreck anyone to see a sibling killed in front of them, we can't help but feel that this is the first ""bad thing"" that's ever happened in Barbara's life and that's why she's such a useless, mentally vacant child for the duration of the film.Tom and Judy are just basic young people, naive and earnest, and appear to be good people. They don't convey the social messages of the other characters leading the film, except in that they are more reasonable and educated than the older white couple, and the younger white man Tom is far more sympathetic to black man Ben and his girlfriend Judy than the odious older white guy.Night of the Living Dead holds up to this day, all the way up to the last five minutes when a group of white rural good 'ol boy sheriffs take out our long-suffering black hero Ben without ever stopping to ask if he's a zombie or still a human being.",21 October 2023

Sure, there had been zombie films before this, but none had managed to be as influential or powerful as this movie stands as a staple of the zombie genre which has since become over saturated, but this will always stand out amongst the crowd of knock offs and remakes.The plot = A group of survivors who barricade themselves in an old, abandoned farmhouse during a zombie outbreak. As time goes by the group quickly begins to clash with each other and descend into madness as the number zombies start to rise. Will anyone be left alive by sunrise.Well, what can I say about this horror masterpiece that hasn't already been said a dozen times before, it's simply one of the greatest examples of an independently made horror flicks where thanks to the talented filmmakers, everything falls into place perfectly. The bleak depiction of dread and isolation simmering in paranoia with a hauntingly surreal atmosphere. The stark black and white photography works wonders against the secluded locations and George A. Romero's direction is outstanding on his debut effort and captures everything with sharp detail and macabre style. The movie is simple yet effective with a tight yet relentless pacing, visually creepy and breathtakingly frightening and even after more than 50 years since its release, it still holds the power to scare audiences.The acting here is strong with Duane Jones's casting here proving to be an inspirational one, especially for its time period and gives an effective leading man performance providing charisma and confidence to the role as he's the driving force of the film and without a doubt he's the shining star here. Judith O'Dea's character is nothing more than a shy, frail damsel in distress, but she does a decent job with the role even if it is limited. The rest of the cast including Karl Hardman, Marilyn Eastman, Kyran Schon, Keith Wayne and Judith Wayne each holds their own and provides solid performances.Overall 'Night of the Living Dead' remains one of the finest horror movies ever made that transcends far beyond the zombie genre and deserves all the recognition it has gained over the years.",18 October 2023
rw9378999,ur164036594,tt0063350," The grandfather of the zombie genre, holds up perfectly at 55 years of age
",9,"The things that might date ""Night of the Living Dead"" to contemporary audiences seeking out this film (budget, acting style, B&W photography) are overcome by just how brilliantly Romero tells a paranoia induced tale out of a simple premise. It's low budget is actually hugely beneficial to this film where Romero is able to keep his focus on one clear setting and a small group of well-defined and interesting characters and it's amazing how everything that has come since from the zombie sub-genre is indebted to ""Night of the Living Dead"" but few films reach its depth as far as social commentary to make it more than just a simple creature feature horror film.The main complaint I remember having with ""Night of the Living Dead"" when I first saw it some ten or so years ago was the female lead and both her acting and her mute, essentially paralyzed (by fear) character who wanders through most of the film powerless to do anything. On this viewing, it's clear to me that the character is someone to whom past physical (and maybe sexual) trauma is manifested during the onset of the zombie attack. Romero borrows from the growing psychological horror film movement of the sixties (films like ""Repulsion"" or ""Carnival of Souls"" for example) with the lead character and while the performance may not be technically flawless, Romero's intentions are admirable in my opinion.The news broadcast of the zombie attack is amazing because it perfectly captures public hysteria and response in a way that feels believable and the ending is incredible because Romero seems to delight in teasing his audience by abandoning more conventional forms of narrative storytelling. It's brutal, uncompromising, terrifying and effective and it clearly works as more than just a zombie film. It's analogous to race relations and the Civil Rights movement of the time where the town sheriff and his posse gun down an innocent black man and cover up the murder by dressing him up as an infected ghoul.""Night of the Living Dead"" is one of the most important horror films of all time but its importance extends beyond its influence on an entire genre of filmmaking because it is still incredibly effective, enjoyable and unsettling to today's audiences as it must have been in 1968.",16 October 2023

The soundtrack is quite amazing as well. I'd say the best part of that film even.All in all I'm not surprised how the movie turned out, but still a little bit puzzled how this has gotten so many good reviews.

",7,"In what was one of Hollywood's first indictments of itself, faded silent film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) offers young, down-on-his-luck screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) the opportunity to stay with her in her lavish, antiquated mansion, where she lives in recluse, dreaming of her bygone days as one of the once budding industry's brightest stars - and hoping that her latest script will give her one last taste of the fame she's incurably addicted to. Billy Wilder illuminates the flip side of celebrity and movie stardom with shrewdness and doubtless first-hand knowledge. But after 70 years of aging, Sunset Boulevard only fully works on that allegorical level. The rest of the movie, with its looming tragedy and noirish shadows, is a little too plotted and melodramatic to really resonate, despite - or perhaps partly because - Swanson's outlandish performance as the ageing diva. She's a ghost of the expressionist traditions she was brought up in, and she's blind to the fact that she's become a parody of her own screen-persona. As the picture revels in this parody, with sprinkles of black comedy which alas are too slight and far between, it does still create its own atmospheric realm that partly explains Joe's lunacy. Thanks to Wilder's skill and an invested William Holden, Sunset Boulevard transports you back to 1950's Hollywood and gives you a fascinating glimpse into its world of theatricality, decline and debauchery.",2 January 2024

",7,"Billy Wilder's ""Sunset Boulevard"" is considered one of the most biting satires of classic Hollywood. A cruel tale of the capriciousness of movie fandom. In his mockery of the industry's sordidness, Wilder turns the history of Tinseltown inside out. He tells a story where a former silent star plays an aging movie diva. Her butler is portrayed by ""The Man You Love to Hate"" - Erich von Stroheim. And yet Billy Wilder himself hadn't come to America until he was almost 30 years old.The director was born in 1906, in the small village of Sucha, Austria-Hungary. When Billy Wilder was 20 he moved to Berlin where he began working as a screenwriter. After the Nazi Party's rise to power, he fled to the United States. There, Wilder finally ended up in Hollywood where he could continue his career in film. In 1939 Wilder had his first success with ""Ninotchka"", a collaboration with fellow German immigrant Ernst Lubitsch. Swedish superstar Greta Garbo appeared in the lead, which, by the way, was her first role in a romantic comedy.""Sunset Boulevard"" began life as a comedy. As work progressed, however, the script became more melodramatic than funny. Wilder first offered the main role to Greta Garbo. When she declined, he turned to Gloria Swanson instead. Then, Montgomery Clift was approached for the male lead, but he wasn't interested. According to him, the notion of an innocent young man being kept by a 60-year-old woman was downright disgusting. The part eventually went to William Holden.Hardly surprising, ""Sunset Boulevard"" became the most anticipated film of the year. The magazine ""Newsweek"" even put Gloria Swanson on its cover before the release. And William Holden's performance reignited his, at the time, dwindling stardom. So, even if the movie was offending Hollywood's powerful moguls, ""Sunset Boulevard"" was rewarded with 11 Academy Award nominations. Billy Wilder himself took home one of them for having written the screenplay.",17 December 2023

rw9478920,ur41154263,tt0043014," Sunset Boulevard: a journey into Hollywood's heart of darkness, headed by Gloria Swanson's layered acting masterclass
",9,"As the movie capital of the world, Los Angeles has always managed to capture people's imaginations. This goes all the way back to the early 20th century, when the advent of the big studios brought about the first Golden Age during the roaring '20 and Hollywood became the center of the film industry. Film became in fact an industry, presenting itself as a 'dream factory', selling to the public the idea of the American dream. This industry was built on bonafide stars, good-looking men and women with whom the audience could identify and who, in their pictures, overcame obstacles to achieve success. Stars like Norma Desmond (or Gloria Swanson, for that matter). In selling the public their dreams, Hollywood has attracted many hopefuls in search or their own American dream. People from all over the world with dreams of being in front of (or sometimes behind) the camera, of becoming the next big star and seeing their name up in lights. Up until this day, Los Angeles is a lightning rod for hordes of aspiring actors/actresses or other artistic hopefuls. Obviously, Hollywood itself is in no small part guilty of sustaining its own myth. Most films about 'the movies' perpetuate this romanticized version of Hollywood as a magical place where dreams come true and anything is possible ""if you just want it enough"".Sunset Boulevard, however, takes a somewhat different approach: through the story of a would-be screenwriter and a washed-up movie star, it offers us a blunt examination of the dark side of Hollywood, a cruel industry with a short memory that stifles creativity and ambition and is quick to dispose of its expendables. We follow B-movie screenwriter Joe Gillis, unable to sell his work and struggling to make ends meet. He is ready to go back to his hometown in Ohio, when a fateful incident makes him stumble upon the decaying Sunset Boulevard mansion of faded silent-movie star Norma Desmond. All but forgotten by the movie-going public and living in isolation, Norma is delusional, believing that fans are still longing for her and that she will make a triumphant return to the big screen. She proposes Joe to move in and help her finish the script that will propel her back into the spotlight. Initially reluctant, but ultimately seduced by the comfort of Norma's wealth, Joe agrees and basically becomes her gigolo.With its brutal dissection of an equally ruthless industry, Sunset Boulevard doesn't so much deconstruct the Hollywood myth as shatter it completely. It looks into the gaping mouth of the monster, one that chews up its stars and spits them out whenever it's done with them. Former stars like Norma are abandoned, neglected by studio executives and the public alike, desperately clinging to their glory days and longing to return to the spotlight. Norma roams the ruin that is her mansion like a vampire, a relic of an older time, in search of a purpose in a fast-changing world.This the fate of the lucky few, the talented people who in addition were fortunate enough to once achieve such success. For the other 99%, the common suckers like Joe, who are either untalented or unlucky, Hollywood is simply a place where dreams go to die. They are never even chewed up by the monster in the first place, but rather spit out immediately. In the world of Sunset Boulevard, these are the people that end up on a bus home to Ohio, their heads hanging in shame. Either that or they become gigolos for middle-aged, mentally disturbed former movie stars, one false move away from ending up face down in the pool of a broken down mansion.Gloria Swanson's gloriously outlandish performance is fully deserving of its iconic status in film history. Her histrionics and over-the-top facial expressions are perfectly suited to the (once) larger-than-life star of the silent movie era, Norma Desmond. She gets to deliver classic lines like ""I AM big, it's the pictures that got small."" Or, when Joe suggests that her script needs a bit more dialogue: ""What for? I can say anything I want with my EYES."" The fact that this was a comeback role (sorry, a RETURN) for Swanson, who in real life was one of the grand dames of Golden Age Hollywood and star of many Cecil B. De Mille's films, obscures the line between fact and fiction. This meta-aspect adds a fascinating extra layer of intrigue to her performance and the film's commentary on Hollywood's shameful treatment of its talent. ""Without me, there wouldn't be any Paramount Studio"", Norma Desmond's claims at one point in the film, but it might as well be Gloria Swanson herself speaking.Swanson's flashiest scene (in a movie full of them) comes at the very end, in an epilogue that is both compelling and deeply tragic. As Norma is about to be arrested for the murder of Joe, she has lost all touch with reality and has disappeared fully into her own dream world. The last scene of the film is transcendent. As Norma comes down the stairs, her descent into madness is complete. A look of insanity in her eyes, she stares directly into the camera, addressing ""those wonderful people out there in the dark."" At this point, I got literal goosebumps. Such a chilling ending, utterly devastating, but perhaps also somehow some sort of perverted tribute to the allure of the spotlight and the magic of the movies? In any case, for me it is up there with the greatest endings of all time.Finally, a word on this film's legacy. It is interesting to see how Sunset Boulevard inspired more films to look at Hollywood through this darker, more cynical lens, like The Player, Birdman, or my all-time favorite film, Mulholland Drive. Sunset Boulevard was undoubtedly a huge inspiration for David Lynch. There are little references throughout his filmography (FBI-agent Gordon Cole!), but specifically the parallels with his own magnum opus are remarkable. There are many plot and thematic similarities and even the title is a nod to this film. Most importantly, just like Sunset Boulevard, Mulholland Drive offers a scathing criticism of the soulless nature of Hollywood and the destructive effect that the movie industry can have on ambitious and talented people. The general concept of an (aspiring) actress in search of an illustrious career on the big screen, gradually growing more disillusioned, before finally giving way to insanity, is the same, but being the singular filmmaker that he is, Lynch of course put his own uniquely nightmarish twist on it. With Mulholland Drive, David Lynch pretty much made it a wrap for the 'cynical exploration of the dark side of Hollywood' subgenre, effectively making it pointless for anyone to have another stab at it. However, it is probably safe to say that Mulholland Drive would have never been made, had it not been for Sunset Boulevard (by Lynch's own admission, it is one of his favorite films ever made).",7 December 2023

Norma Desmond, once the greatest star of all, has got stuck in the greatness of her glorious past to the degree that she no longer has any connection with reality, and the only thing she is living for is her return to the glory of her past. An impoverished screen writer has the misfortune to end up in her extravagant house of incredible luxury and sumptuousness and is caught up in her dream, which leads him into a blind alley of irrevocable personal annihilation, which when he tries to break out of it at last only inevitably becomes the end of him. Gloria Swanson makes a magnificent performance twenty years after her departure from her Hollywood glory, and William Holden makes an impossible role possible and tragically credible. Then we have all the cameos or icons, like Buster Keaton, Hedda Hooper, Cecil B. DeMille, Anna Q Nilsson and other living ghosts of the silent era, a great score by Franz Waxman not intruding on the action, and a marvellous cinematography and stage settings, but the top of the masterpiece is the manuscript.

",10,"I wanted to kick back and relax tonight by watching three Damien Chazelle films back to back, because in my mind, they form a loose trilogy: Whiplash, La La Land, and Babylon. They all deal with the pursuit of making great art or achieving greatness, and how that clashes with various other things most people place importance on, to summarise the three as broadly as possible.I somehow forgot how stressful the first of these movies was, making it a difficult film to relax to. Even watching Whiplash for what I think is my fourth time does nothing to make it less stressful. Even Uncut Gems, which I've seen a few times now, has gotten a bit less intense with every rewatch. But Whiplash still makes me feel borderline light-headed for much of its runtime, and for that I really respect it. I also love how I still don't know entirely what I think of that excellent ending. The core conflict of the film is one I still think about often, and Whiplash not coming down hard one way or the other is the smartest things it does, at least thematically.Chazelle's later films are visually stronger and bolder, but Whiplash is just so wonderfully tight and free of even a second of filler. It's still a good-looking movie, but I feel like most of its visual flair comes from the editing, which is phenomenal, and heightens the intensity of the music, performances, and writing immensely. If Whiplash isn't a perfect movie, then it's so close it might well be. I love it immensely, even though it makes me nauseous.",4 January 2024

",8,"The one thing that makes reaching a conclusion about this movie the hardest, is the fact that though Fletcher undeniably mentally and (partly) even physically maltreats his students, he does have a point in terms of what it takes to achieve ones dreams. His messages might be particularly triggering for people constantly chasing highs, with lack of dedication and determination to ""finish"" a goal. The ability to persevere through hard work, to sacrifice what needs to be sacrificed and to withstand self-doubt has become especially detrimental at times of instant gratification.What is it that leads someone to greatness, to near perfection? Would we all maybe profit from internalising some version of Fletcher whenever we set out to accomplish something? I am confident that most viewers feel the same way I felt about Fletcher: It's a hate/love relationship. And that's clearly what Andrew ends up feeling for his abusive mentor. Damien Chazelle has managed to perfectly capture every imaginable station a dreamer's emotional rollercoaster consists of: the suffering, the arrogance, the self-doubt, the overconfidence, the humbling, the pushing beyond ones limits, the giving up, the comeback. It's a truly powerful plot that explores the depths of human psychology while contrasting them to the inclination towards seeking shelter and comfort in the conventional. Particularly in the beginning one can see how Andrew struggles with himself: on the one hand he finds comfort in the quiet and conventional life he has with his family; people society wouldn't regard as valuable. Particularly not the type of society Andrew strives to be a part of. He lights up while talking to his date Nicole about the fact that he still enjoys watching movies with his dad. It's the child that comes out only to be annihilated by the later Andrew that chooses to be one of the greats of his century. The ending of the movie, however, leaves one with a few existential questions: You hear about Fletcher's previous student that commits suicide due to the pressure he no longer can withstand. A name of irrelevance to most, shattered before it ever shone. All the hard work gone with him in his grave. You see Nicole who has moved on with her life and found someone without a superiority complex, who probably defines success in a very different way to Andrew. And ultimately, it leads you to ask this: Who of all will - at the end of it all - be happiest?Perhaps the ultimate questions are these:1) How much are you willing to sacrifice for a dream?But then inversely:

The very realization that I would have to practice the same thing on a regular basis over a long period of time throws me off. Constancy is clearly not my strong suit. Today I'm doing one thing, and tomorrow I'm burned out and doing something completely new. It's hard to master one skill perfectly under those circumstances, but you can try a lot of things. Maybe this is MY way - to try the world in all its diversity!However, Andrew Newman knows exactly what he wants - he wants to become the best drummer and is ready to wipe his hands in blood to realize his dream. One day his playing is noticed by the conductor of the best student orchestra in the country and he is invited to join the troupe. As stereotypical as geniuses are often portrayed in movies, Damien Chazelle's film portrays the conductor himself as stereotypical - overbearing, ruthless, manipulative, but a true creator and builder. Are you ready to endure anger, rage and emotional swings from a mentor who wants to awaken the great musician in you?After the tragic death of one of the conductor's previous students, an investigation begins into the teaching methods of Terence Fletcher (that's the conductor's name). At some point Andrew too breaks under the teacher's onslaught and it seems that the path to his dream is complete. So Andrew also decides to testify against his idol, after which the conductor is suspended from running the orchestra.The story could have ended there, if not for the love of music. Some time later Terence invites Andrew to play the drum part at one of the festivals, which is important for the future of musicians - the jury members can give a ticket to life or close all roads to the professional world. Either out of a desire for revenge or intentionally manipulating Andrew's feelings once again, the conductor sets the drummer up and plays a part for which the drummer was unprepared, resulting in Andrew's public embarrassment. But instead of breaking down again, he takes the next beat into his own hands and already begins to lead the entire orchestra. In the end, Andrew and the conductor become so obsessed with the music and themselves that they produce something ""beyond human capabilities,"" as Movie Search says about it. Without irony, the final scene was indeed very musical and inspired.Nevertheless, I have mixed impressions about this movie. Some bitter aftertaste because of the behavior of the main character and his mentor. Probably because such teaching methods are just not for me. But maybe that's why I won't become great, who knows.On the other hand, the drum parts with absolutely frantic rhythm and the general atmosphere of the movie are mesmerizing and keep you in suspense throughout the whole picture.

Damien Chazelle's masterpiece is unlike anything I've seen before, a heart-pounding symphony of ambition and obsession that left me on the edge of my seat from start to finish.First off, let's talk about Miles Teller as Andrew Neiman. I was completely blown away by his performance. The guy not only nailed the intense drumming sequences (seriously, my heart was racing during those scenes), but he also brought such depth to his character. You could feel Andrew's burning desire for greatness, and as the story unfolded, I found myself both rooting for him and fearing for his sanity.And J. K. Simmons as Terence Fletcher-wow, just wow. I can't imagine anyone else in that role. Simmons was a force of nature, this relentless, almost terrifying presence as the music instructor. Fletcher's teaching methods were borderline insane, but Simmons played him with such nuance that I found myself questioning whether his intensity was a necessary evil or just straight-up abuse of power. No wonder he bagged the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.The whole atmosphere of the film was just electric. The drumming, the jazz, the tension-it all blended together in this perfect storm of emotions. The cinematography and the score elevated every moment, making even the smallest practice session feel like a life-or-death situation. The way Chazelle captured the competitive world of music conservatories was nothing short of genius.But it's not just about the music; it's about the human cost of chasing perfection. The film had me contemplating the lengths one should go to achieve greatness. Is it worth sacrificing everything? The relationships, the health, the sanity? ""Whiplash"" doesn't shy away from these tough questions, and it left me pondering the blurred lines between motivation and abuse, success and obsession.The dialogue was razor-sharp. I mean, I could quote lines from this movie all day. Each word felt like a punch, driving home the film's themes about the relentless pursuit of one's dreams. And the editing-oh, don't get me started. The tight shots during drumming sequences, the rapid editing during confrontations, it all added to the intensity. I was literally on the edge of my seat, hanging on every beat.In the end, ""Whiplash"" isn't just a movie; it's an experience. It celebrates the pursuit of excellence while forcing you to confront the price of that pursuit. I'm still processing everything, but one thing's for sure: ""Whiplash"" has left an indelible mark on me. It's a cinematic gem that will stay with me for a long, long time.

",7,"As is often the case, the reputation of something can be so great, that it becomes difficult in reality to meet the expectations such regard can create. Perhaps this was a factor that shaped my opinion about 'Double Indemnity', and I therefore should be mindful of that when judging this movie. I liked and enjoyed it, which my rating intends to convey. But there were a couple of aspects that slightly disappointed me as well.Modern viewers probably need to recognise and keep in mind, a couple of important contextual points regarding this movie. Firstly, its subject material, plot and characters - particularly the portrayal of a woman of questionable virtue - had become rare for an A-level feature film in the United States, after the enforcement of the Production Code in 1934. Secondly, its commercial success proved that the movie-going public had an appetite for the genre, encouraging the industry to create the numerous imitators which soon followed.One could draw a parallel that this movie did in 1944, what Pulp Fiction (1994) did fifty years later. They both pushed the boundaries of what was palatable subject material, introducing new edgy dialogue and interactions between the characters, creating a new kind of ""Cool"" for their respective eras.I was disappointed with Fred MacMurray's lead performance, but it should be noted that my opinion here is definitely in the minority. I felt his efforts weren't very natural, especially in his scenes with Barbara Stanwyck, who came across as more comfortable in her role. Edward G. Robinson was unsurprisingly brilliant, and of these three mentioned stood out the most.Most people will enjoy this movie, and plenty will go much further with their praise. I personally rate it a fair way short of the greatest films noir, but of course, that is a very high bar indeed.",2 October 2023

",7,"In many ways, 'Double Indemnity' stands as the quintessential film noir. The crackling dialogue, a result of director Billy Wilder's collaboration with famed novelist Raymond Chandler, based on James Cain's pulp novel of the same name, coupled with the exceptional noirish cinematography by John Seitz, positions the film deservedly among the all-time great noirs of its era.However, I'm hesitant to award the film a perfect 10 out of 10 rating without addressing some deficiencies that slightly diminish its overall appeal.Undoubtedly, 'Double Indemnity' was a groundbreaking and highly controversial film for its time. Based on a murder that occurred in 1920s Queens, New York, the film delves into the sinister plot between a woman and her lover to murder the woman's husband for insurance money.Initially, the Production Code posed a challenge to the film's creation due to the salacious nature of the story. Even the film's star, Barbara Stanwyck, who portrayed the femme fatale Phyllis Dietrichson, expressed reservations about embodying the role of an amoral killer.Certain critics might have preferred a more glamorous femme fatale, yet Stanwyck's more ""ordinary"" appearance is, in fact, perfect in capturing the intended note of banality when paired with co-star Fred MacMurray, who takes on the role of Walter Neff, an ""average"" insurance agent.However, the banality of their relationship becomes the narrative's Achilles heel. While chemistry occasionally surfaces through the aforementioned dynamic dialogue (notably Phyllis's clever allusion to exceeding the speed limit when Walter first makes sexual advances), the initial interactions between the two mainly revolve around the gradual acceptance of the notion of committing murder. This progression unfolds rather slowly, causing the suspense to truly heighten only when the actual murder transpires.Fortunately, the inclusion of Edward G. Robinson as Claims Investigator Barton Keyes injects a magnetic force into the film. Keyes, one of Robinson's most iconic roles, captivatingly portrays competence, especially in the memorable scene where he exposes a fraudulent insurance claim.The compellingly unique circumstances of the murder-where Walter impersonates the victim on a train-capture the audience's attention. Equally fascinating is Keyes's deduction that the death of Dietrichson (Tom Powers) was neither accidental nor a suicide, although he fails to connect Walter to the crime.Here, the subplot involving Dietrichson's daughter, Lola (Jean Heather), who stands to inherit her father's estate, plays a role. Regrettably, much of the suspense involving Lola remains unseen on screen, a notable narrative weakness.As the plot advances, Walter's alliance with Phyllis takes a dramatic turn when he discovers her collusion with Nino Zachette (Byron Barr), Lola's on-and-off boyfriend, potentially for Lola's murder.The anticipated denouement sees Walter and Phyllis face their due consequences. However, I find Phyllis's sudden change of heart, leading her to spare her lover, slightly less convincing.In the realm of cinema, 'Double Indemnity' stands as one of the rare films where continuous narration effectively enhances the dialogue's imagery. The film's authenticity is bolstered by its adept incorporation of insightful references to the insurance industry, complementing Robinson's remarkably realistic performance.",23 August 2023

",5,"This is one wild film. It's long, it's all over the place in terms of it's tone, the editing can be rapid and the dialogue comes sharp and fast. We don't really know much about our two protagonists but that's often the way with a western. It's a violent film, in which the violence mostly means very little, a death happens, often for comedic effect, the next scene all is forgotten. You also know throughout the film it's all building up to a bloodbath, that's the way his films work. It's also a revenge movie though it's hard to feel engaged given the way it's executed. The characters are very much that, characters not real people. It also is sort of tongue in cheek making fun of the old spaghetti western genera of movie, everything is all a bit over the top. All the main characters are impossibly charismatic, clever, witty, perfect gunmen etc. The villain played by Leo Di Caprio of all of people is pretty diabolical, a sadistic slaver owner who makes his slaves wrestle to the death for his entertainment and is obsessed with French culture. Despite being set in 19th century America characters appear to wear sunglasses and hip hop music often blazes over action scenes. The first 40 minutes is pretty plotless but the story does then improve, a period of real tension is sustained. Our two heroes must go undercover to rescue Jamie Lee Fox's wife but he must of course conceal his emotion and outrage when seeing her mistreated. It reaches fever pitch when Leo's character given some new knowledge begins to grow suspicious. Can our heroes keep their cool and pull off their heist?Samuel Jackson also plays a very different character to his usual kind in movies, I liked him in this. Things do get pretty far fetched at the end, it suddenly turns into Rambo, our hero can take on dozens of men without taking a single hit. It's also made worse by the director suddenly showing up to play an Australian character which doesn't go well. Many of the characters are undone by their own stupidity, greed and violence.",23 December 2023

",6,"""Django Unchained"" is Quentin Tarantino at the height of his filmmaking prowess, delivering a bold, brutal, and unapologetic masterpiece that redefines the Western genre. Set against the backdrop of slavery in the pre-Civil War United States, the film follows the journey of Django (Jamie Foxx), a freed slave turned bounty hunter, as he seeks to rescue his wife from a sadistic plantation owner.Tarantino's signature style is on full display, seamlessly blending gritty realism with moments of dark humor. The film's dialogue is sharp and memorable, creating characters that are both larger than life and deeply human. Christoph Waltz, as the charismatic Dr. King Schultz, provides a standout performance that earned him a well-deserved Academy Award.Jamie Foxx's portrayal of Django is both powerful and nuanced, transforming the character from a man seeking revenge into a symbol of empowerment and resistance. The chemistry between Foxx and Waltz forms the heart of the narrative, as their unlikely partnership navigates the treacherous landscape of the pre-Civil War South.Leonardo DiCaprio gives a chilling performance as the sadistic plantation owner Calvin Candie. DiCaprio's commitment to the role adds a layer of menace to the character, making him one of the most memorable villains in recent cinematic history. The supporting cast, including Kerry Washington and Samuel L. Jackson, further elevates the film with their compelling performances.The film's cinematography, under the lens of Robert Richardson, is visually stunning. The wide shots of the Southern landscapes and the intense close-ups during moments of tension contribute to the film's immersive experience. Tarantino's use of an eclectic soundtrack, blending contemporary music with the period setting, adds a unique and dynamic layer to the storytelling.""Django Unchained"" is more than a revenge tale; it's a social commentary on the horrors of slavery and the resilience of the human spirit. Tarantino doesn't shy away from depicting the brutality of the era, and the film serves as a cathartic exploration of justice and retribution.In conclusion, ""Django Unchained"" is a cinematic triumph that combines Tarantino's trademark style with a powerful narrative and exceptional performances. It's a visceral and thought-provoking experience that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll. If you're a fan of Tarantino's work or simply appreciate bold storytelling, ""Django Unchained"" is a must-watch.",18 December 2023

I also enjoyed his partner Dr King Schultz and he was one of my favorite characters throughout the movie. I also liked how Django was doing all of this in the end for the girl he loved and would not stop till he got to her. I liked when Dr King Schultz looked back at Calvin Candie and walked up and shot him just because he wanted to. Then after that happened Django had a big fight. It was him going against everybody and he took out as many as he could before they threatened to do something to the girl he loved. This was one of the coolest scenes I have ever seen.

rw9467469,ur153983000,tt1853728," Entertaining but overlong
",6,"Whenever I see film run for almost three hours, there is an inevitable sense of trepidation I feel. Immediately the question beckons: is it a three hour film because the plot needed the time, or is it too long and over indulgent. While this may be a controversial opinion, I think Django Unchained is afflicted with the latter problem. This is a massive shame because apart from its tired, extended, overindulgent pacing, Django Unchained represents a spectacular, mesmerising, and daring innovation in the genre. In true Tarantino style, there is blood everywhere, and the n word is used probably hundreds of times. There are also brilliant central performances in Jamie Foxx, Leonardo Dicarpio, and of course the inimitable Christoph Waltz. Waltz In particular offers an outstanding performance as a charming, self assured German bounty hunter with European civility and a deep dislike for slavery. The dynamic between Django and Schultz is also interesting for there is a true kinship between these two disparate characters. However I feel the film is definitely way too long, and it is overly indulgent near the middle and end section. Too much time is spent at Candyland inspecting prospective ""Mandingo"" purchases, and there is an extended sequence at the end which is really unnecessary. The film could have easily quit at the bloody shoot out near the end but it chose not to. In fact almost a full 2 hours is spent at candyland itself. While Tarantino is a good suspense writer, I doubt even Hitchcock would have been adept enough to keep teh audience in suspense for a full two hours. Consequently I felt boredom starting to set in near the two hour mark- at the point where I feel the film should have ended. The movie also overplays the oneupmanship of Django and Schultz that it becomes overly grating(oh look, it's another white man surprised at a black man on a horse). I think these flaws make Django unchained way too long. If I could judge a film as a collection of solely it's good bits, Django Unchained is a masterpiece. But a film is ultimately representative of a directors vision, and it must be judged as a whole. Django Unchained in its entirety is a missed opportunity, where a snappier pace would have really made it something great.",1 December 2023

I loved everything about Django and especially the scene where he blows up Candyland and kills everyone. Jamie Foxx is a talented actor and this movie really helped show how great he is. His talent is impeccable and same can be said with Leonardo DiCaprio, Cristoph Waltz, and Kerry Washington. This movie was thrilling and each second, I was jumping out of my seat, excited. This movie exceeded beyond my expectations and it's really shown me how great film making is. I also have to say that I love the cameo from Quentin Tarantino himself and Jonah Hill.

",10,"""Django Unchained,"" directed by Quentin Tarantino, is a bold and visceral film that delves into the dark and harrowing realities of slavery in the United States. Released in 2012, the movie received critical acclaim for its unflinching portrayal of the antebellum South, its powerful performances, and Tarantino's distinctive style.Set in the pre-Civil War era, the story follows Django (played by Jamie Foxx), a freed slave who becomes a bounty hunter and seeks to rescue his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), from a brutal Mississippi plantation owner, Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). Alongside him is Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), a German bounty hunter who becomes Django's mentor and partner.Tarantino's signature style is evident throughout the film, blending a mix of intense violence, sharp wit, and poignant social commentary. The movie doesn't shy away from showcasing the grotesque and inhumane treatment of slaves, using brutality to underscore the harsh realities faced by African Americans during that period. However, it balances this with moments of triumph, empowerment, and vengeance, as Django navigates a path of self-discovery and reclamation of his identity.The performances in ""Django Unchained"" are exceptional. Jamie Foxx delivers a compelling portrayal of Django, displaying both vulnerability and strength in his quest for justice. Christoph Waltz shines as Schultz, with his charismatic and enigmatic portrayal, earning him an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Additionally, Leonardo DiCaprio's chilling performance as the despicable and charming Candie adds depth to the film's exploration of the inherent evil within the institution of slavery.Moreover, the film's soundtrack, combining an eclectic mix of genres, effectively complements the narrative, enhancing the emotional depth of various scenes.Tarantino masterfully weaves together elements of spaghetti Westerns with a revisionist history approach, creating an alternate reality that empowers its protagonist in a time where power differentials were starkly defined. Through its artistic and dramatic storytelling, the film forces audiences to confront uncomfortable truths about America's history of slavery and racism.However, the film also generated controversy due to its explicit depiction of violence and the use of racial slurs, which some critics argued could be excessive and uncomfortable for some viewers.In conclusion, ""Django Unchained"" is a gripping and thought-provoking film that confronts the horrors of slavery while offering a tale of resilience, retribution, and the fight for freedom. It remains a significant and impactful piece of cinema, showcasing Tarantino's ability to blend entertainment with social commentary in a compelling and unforgettable manner.",6 November 2023

",9,"For reasons both personal and broadly societal, rewatching Amadeus in 2023, it feels like a film about how a fairly smart person who's capable of evil will always triumph over and crush a smarter person who's naive or doesn't have the same sort of malicious spirit. Further, though the person capable of evil succeeds, they'll never be happy; nothing will ever be enough. That's a small thing to hold onto (I can't call it a comfort) in this otherwise tragic story (that's not a spoiler, considering the protagonist states how things will broadly end early on).I didn't remember Salieri being quite so evil and despicable when I watched this at a younger age, and I don't think I pitied Mozart as much either. If you want to call immaturity a flaw, then sure, he's flawed, but I don't think he's evil or morally compromised. Salieri is someone who, at least according to himself, is able to manipulate people to do what he wants, and that requires some level of cunning and cleverness. But he's not smart enough to realise he's set himself up for continual disappointment. He may achieve what he wants, but he never should've set out to achieve such a thing in the first place.When these two characters share a scene, Amadeus shines. I guess even when they're not directly together, they're still fascinating characters, and both lead actors are phenomenal. It's rare to see a film that's this well acted, this well written, and this well shot, all at once. All the elements are almost always working in perfect harmony, and it makes for a powerful film that's full of emotional highs and lows.So, why not a perfect score? The extended cut is the only one available to me, and I just feel it's a tiny bit overlong at 180 minutes. I'd love to see if the 160 minute cut would feel better. I think all the scenes are necessary here, but it might be more that a handful of scenes here and there just last a little longer than they need to. Otherwise, pacing for the extended version aside, I feel like Amadeus is a close-to-perfect film, and has held up extremely well over the last four decades.",20 December 2023

rw9427404,ur0225436,tt0086879," Sour Notes and Poisoned Chords: The Salieri-Mozart Rivalry
",3,"Regrettably, I ended up stuck in an additional twenty minutes of director Milos Forman's ""director's cut"" of Amadeus. As if it weren't long enough already! The film is based on Peter Schaeffer's stage play of the same name, but someone decided to expand it by tossing in more characters.Crafting a biographical film about creative geniuses is always a dicey venture. Their lives often lack the dramatic punch we expect from the big screen, especially when their history is veiled in speculation. And this is precisely where Schaeffer's rendition of Mozart's too-short life takes center stage.The crux of the tale revolves around the fabricated rivalry between the Italian composer Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) and Mozart (Tom Hulce). This operatic grudge match unfolds in the court of the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones) during the late 18th century.Salieri, now an elderly man confined in a lunatic asylum in 1823, narrates the story. Unfortunately, Forman sporadically interrupts the plot with Salieri's ramblings and confessions to a priest, adding a dose of unnecessary complexity.The idea of a feud between Salieri and Mozart was tossed around as early as 1830 by Russian poet Pushkin, but, truth be told,
there's little concrete evidence to confirm its existence.Schaeffer paints Salieri as a bitter, celibate soul, but history tells a different tale; the man actually fathered eight children. There's hardly anything endearing about Salieri except, perhaps, a flicker of redemption in the character's waning moments.It's hard to root for a character as venomously jealous as Salieri, who spends his time scheming to thwart Mozart at every turn. The nadir arrives when he sabotages Mozart's shot at becoming a court composer after his wife initially rebuffs Salieri's repugnant advances (though he later has a change of heart, the damage is done).And then there's Mozart himself. Throughout the film, he comes off as an insufferable man-child with the most irritating giggle in cinematic history.The real story kicks off when Mozart relocates from his hometown of Salzburg to Vienna, aiming to curry favor with the Emperor. There's a decent scene in which Mozart instantly elevates a mediocre march composition penned by Salieri for the Emperor.While Mozart's wife, Constanze (Elizabeth Berridge), is consistently spouting anachronistic lines, the casting missteps pale in comparison to some saving graces. Jeffrey Jones plays the Emperor, avoiding the stereotypical portrayal of a dictatorial ruler, while Roy Dotrice nails the role of Mozart's proud and critical father, Leopold.The film does shed some light on Mozart's musical background, particularly his operatic works, like The Marriage of Figaro, initially considered scandalous but ultimately greenlit. The opera Don Giovanni, it seems, was inspired by Mozart's father's demise.A considerable chunk of screen time is dedicated to chronicling Mozart's woeful descent into alcoholism and financial woes. Towards the end of his life, he was blacklisted and had to rely on the goodwill of friends.The narrative implies that Salieri attempts to poison Mozart, yet it never outright shows Salieri carrying out the nefarious act. The film keeps it somewhat hazy whether Salieri genuinely administered the poison or if Mozart's demise resulted from other factors, leaving room for interpretation.Surprisingly, there's a brief moment when Salieri appears to exhibit compassion or remorse. Witnessing Mozart's pitiful state and recognizing the extent of his torment, Salieri steps in to help Mozart complete his Requiem Mass. It's an odd concoction of guilt, pity, and a strange sort of admiration for Mozart's genius.The film artfully constructs a complex and ambiguous portrayal of Salieri's involvement in Mozart's death, leaving viewers to ponder whether it was the result of Salieri's actions or the unfortunate circumstances around him.F. Murray Abraham won the Best Actor Award for his performance as Salieri, but the problem remains - he's largely depicted as unsympathetic, lacking the charm to engage audiences in his character's envious and conniving nature.",11 November 2023

In the city that could not give the fitting praise to the genius of Mozart in his time.As one of the foremost lovers of his music, I know his biography well. And that Salieri was not to blame for the early death of Mozart. We musiclovers will forever struggle with the big question: what masterworks could never be written, how many grandios operas can never be performed, because the only one, who was able to write them died too early.But fate did not allow it! And that is the phenomenal trick of Amadeus that this fate is given a single face - that of Salieri. And so the viewer is able to experience the fate of Mozart in a translation that travels through similar emotions, like those we feel globally about the early loss of Mozart. And this is - pure art!We see a fake story, but this fake story is closer to our common felt historical pain than any true documentary could tell us.It was a terrible failure of the Academy not to give the Oscar for best actor to both, Abraham and Hulce.The final scene, Mozart in his deathbed teaches Salieri, how to go on with the music score of his Requiem, is acting at the very highest level. No doubt, Hulce and Abraham are - in this moment - fully, totally, Mozart and Salieri.It is always difficult to find a right rating 7, 8 or 9 for a very good movie. But if you see a rating-10-movie (for my taste there might be appr. 30 movies around, I would rate 10), there is no doubt that it deserves a 10. And, absolutely no doubt, Milos Foreman's Amadeus is one of these movies!Before the projection of the movie the daughter of Eric Pleskow (president of the Viennale for 20 years and producer of Amadeus in 1984) gave the Oscar statue for Amadeus as best picture to Eva Sangiori, the present director of the Viennale, as a gift to the Viennale - a very nice gesture!",31 October 2023

",10,"Well, what can I say. The film is a masterpiece.Filmed in a format that I love more than anything - a narrative format where there is a narrator who is also a character in the film. One of my favorite films - ""Suspicious Persons"" - was shot in this style.The contemporary life of bohemians and, occasionally, ordinary people is beautifully conveyed.This is a film about a rock star of that time - outrageous, extraordinary, a little provincial. The main character's problem, in my opinion, is a partial non-acceptance by the contemporary society, caused by established stereotypes and frameworks, unable to grasp something new and ingenious. But at the same time, Amadeus achieves recognition, and the problem of geniuses is precisely that they are often misunderstood by society.In fact, the main character is the narrator Salieri, who touches on the subject of God and tries to explain everything that happens by the actions of a ""higher power"", because of which he develops fanaticism, which leads to personality disorders. And, simply put, envy is a deadly sin.Returning to Amadeus himself, one can see his certain lack of independence and inability to take the initiative into his own hands. Most of his decisions are made through the mediation of first the father, who is skeptical of his son's talent and hobbies, and then the woman, who has a mercantile outlook on life and demands that the man concentrate more on wealth than on creativity.I myself performed Mozart's compositions on the piano, so it was very informative and exciting to evaluate this film.",23 October 2023

It opens with all the things we've now grown to expect from them 3 men and their ugly, sweaty, bearded weathered faces, with greasy hair and the sweat shinning off them, this is not a romantic west at all, but a dirty and violent place but one with great style and flair too. The cinematography is really great in this film, it lends it an operatic quality as does the music, the camera is able to glide through and above the characters. The Blu Ray transfer is excellent, it's a widescreen movie and one that avoids lots of bold primary colours in favour of a more worn out look. It still has a few flaws, the obvious dubbing, the cartoony sound effects when people are punched but generally this is a really stylish film, the humour if there is any is very subtle, all the characters have a certain mystery to them, we don't know them and they don't really know each other. Character introductions are handled really well, they really announce themselves, one character is so mysterious we don't even know his name and neither does anyone else apparently. He just sits in the corner of the bar and plays his harmonica, the music from it and even the sound of trains breaking is mixed into the soundtrack so well. The plot is a bit convoluted and messy at times, half way through one character has to spend about 2 minutes of exposition explaining what's happening and how he saw it all in a document, they were probably aware the audience would be getting lost by that point. There's a scene early on which is simply horrific and is a complete shocker, it's a shame though it's largely forgotten about towards the end among all the characters. For me though it's still haunting and done with practically no music. As ever the source of all the hurt and suffering and death is greed, greed over money, greed over land, the country wasn't build by purely noble spirits the film seems to be telling us. The ending though really works, it goes on but I found all of that last bit very satisfying. There's still a little bit of the old romantic left in the spaghetti western too, and this film has it. Directed by an Italian and filmed in the USA it's almost like an opera, it's that personal and epic. The film does borrow from others but it does it in it's own unique style.

I think this might be my favourite British film of all time. It's also I think arguably the greatest love story on film, with Brief Encounter the only other option. The film deserves so much praise for the set design, the excellent script, Lawrence Olivier is brilliant as a lonely troubled widower when we first meet him, rich, aristocratic yet sorrowful and distant it's all there in the performance, the way he carries himself, it's sublime. The costumes all look extremely pleasing yet also modern and real, the film also takes you back to a day of manners and a strict social class system where the rich might spend there days at Monte Carlo while a keen sense of hierarchy is preserved back in there stately homes. You really feel and care for our main character, superbly played by Joan Fontaine who seems so earnest, insecure and caring yet so full of self doubt too and so often made to feel inadequate by those around her, either deliberately or accidently. The film constantly raises the question of who's in charge, one character seems to not so much ask as tell her what will happen next around the house. The film makes great use of light and shadow to hint at the mystery in the story and the internal conflict within the character. The beautiful house at times feel overwhelmingly large and intimidating and at times empty. The film later turns into more a crime thriller with great tension between the characters who also have great conflict within themselves, there's just so much happening in every scene. Big twists come, the characters become more morally grey but also more interesting, our new young wife assumes a stronger more protective personality while another charming but slightly threating man appears on the scene and is given all the best lines. Secrets are revealed but then struggled to conceal leading to greater tension yet. A scene involving a huge fire also looks magnificent near the end.The acting, cinematography and story cannot be praised enough.

",10,"Sergio Leone directed seven feature films throughout his career. Seven films out of which six, grouped in two trilogies, are enough for his name to be considered today among the most important directors of the 20th century. 'Once Upon a Time in the West' (1968) is the first film of the second trilogy. In the previous years he had made the three spaghetti western films which are today considered a revolution in the history of the western genre and perhaps the films that saved this genre and demonstrated its vitality, ensuring it a future. The first films were made with the modest financial means typical of European films. In 1968, for 'Once Upon a Time in the West', Leone obtained financing from one of the major American studios, Paramount. With their money he afforded a lavish production and he was able to approach first rank Hollywood stars for casting. Henri Fonda responded, and his inclusion in the cast is a nice homage to classic American westerns. Asa reward, Leone cast him in the first big 'bad guy' role of his career and gave him the opportunity to play for the first time ... in a bedroom scene. He filmed lavishly, with many extras and super production sets. Some scenes are filmed in the American state of Utah, in the desert area where the story of the film takes place. However, most of the filming was again done in Spain, as in the previous films, and the studio scenes at Cinecittà. After changing the destiny of westerns, Sergio Leone inaugurates with this film the 'Once Upon a Time ...' trilogy and opens a new perspective to the genre of the great American epics.The original script is signed by Leone together with Sergio Donati, but Bernardo Bertolucci and Dario Argento also took part in the writing of the story on which it is based. We are in a dusty town on the edge of the desert, on America's moving frontier. Construction of the railroad that will cross the continent to the Pacific is nearing. If there are laws, they aren't really followed, and everyone kind of makes their own law, often with the help of guns and gunmen gangs. Jill McBain is a beautiful woman from New Orleans who arrives in the city to meet her future husband. However, she finds herself in the situation of a widow, because the man she had married by correspondence had just been assassinated along with his three children. The reason and the stake is the land in his property, through which the railway line is to pass, land which the tycoon Morgan wants to seize with the help of the gunmen gang led by a bad fellow named Frank. Jill decides to stay to fight for the inherited property and to make her husband's dream of building a prosperous city around a future train station a reality. She will be helped by other characters always on the edge of the law and by a mysterious man who plays the harmonica and seems interested in Frank's person. They all wield their guns with dexterity, and these don't stay unused too long time throughout the story.Sergio Leone narrates as if he and his audience have all the time in the world. A scene can last ten or fifteen minutes, culminating in a gunfight lasting a few seconds. Each scene, however, is a story in itself, with characters that we know to the whites of their eyes and a setting in which we seem to be absorbed. Today a duration of more than two and a half hours for a film is something common, but in the 60s it was an exception. Sergio Leone actually sets a kind of standard in terms of running time for films depicting great American stories. To accommodate the format of American screenings, producers and distributors created shorter versions, and this also happened here and with other of his films. Each of the actors is given plenty of time to develop their character, and this happens even with the supporting roles, and there are many memorable ones in 'Once Upon a Time in the West'. The big roles cast is outstanding. Sergio Leone chooses first-rate actors, but counter-casts them in roles different than the usual in their careers up to that point, which reinforces the freshness feeling that we get while watching the film. Henry Fonda abandons the character of a man of justice and good causes and crosses over to the other side of the law. Charles Bronson on the other hand gives one of the best roles of his career as a positive character in the role of the mysterious man with a harmonica, proving what a good actor he was in addition to his acting talent in action films. Claudia Cardinale develops with charm and charisma the role of the widow, a role that was originally written for Sophia Loren. Ennio Morricone's music is organically integrated into the complete visual and emotional experience this film provides. 'Once Upon a Time in the West' is a timeless masterpiece.",12 December 2023

",7,"The films of Alfred Hitchcock and decades after the master's departure are remembered for their unique atmosphere. Sometimes his style is elusive in a particular scene, more often it excites when the viewer sees that memorable suspense and tension. ""Rebecca"" is a project a little unusual for the work of Alfred Hitchcock. Although all the recognizable aspects of the director are present here, the detective and the love line come to the fore. And this is undoubtedly a successful approach to the presentation of this particular work.I remember the picture and the variety of beautiful plans. The team of creators did a great job on the scenery, presenting the rather detailed rooms of the mansion to the audience.But the main characters in the film, of course, are the characters played by Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier. Moreover, in my opinion, Olivier acts as a ""second fiddle"". The main decoration of the painting is Fontaine, her game pleases and fascinates. The heroine looks both strong and lost, puzzled, and sometimes afraid of what is happening. The whole range of acting skills of the actress allows you to feel how complex her heroine is. I am sure that other contenders for this role, among whom, by the way, were the stars of the recent ""Gone with the Wind"" Vivien Leigh and Olivia de Havilland, would hardly be able to convey the image of the heroine, which was so successfully embodied by Fontaine.Olivier is also good. The Englishman very subtly conveyed the aristocratic image of his hero, who has all the recognizable features of such persons. His hero is confident, determined, and of course it is his story that becomes something to be explored by both the heroine of the film and the audience.The acting work of all the other participants in this project is also good. I wouldn't single out anyone in particular, everyone coped perfectly. Hitchcock, as a masterful director, perfectly staged the picture, playing on the feelings of the audience and skillfully presenting this or that scene exactly as he knows how. The picture became the best at the Oscar ceremony in the corresponding year, taking the coveted statuette. The second award, which the creators could boast of, was the best work of the operator.""Rebecca"" is a worthy film of its time. Often the picture is forgotten because of the more famous works of the master of suspense, including the legendary ""Psycho"", ""Birds"", ""Window to the courtyard"" or ""In case of murder, dial ""M"". However, this is a high-quality project that will still be interesting today with its unforgettable atmosphere of detective and drama.The authors elegantly conveyed a mysterious story that is literally imbued with the intangible, but very distinct and even dangerous presence of the one called Rebecca.7 out of 10.",30 July 2023
rw9144930,ur30753782,tt0032976," Rebecca review
",8,"Rebecca represents a major turning point in Alfred Hitchcock's career. It was his first American-made film, allowing him to capitalize on the hopes and dreams of working with a bigger budget and more equipment, furthering the masterful technical control so central to his style.Looming large over the entire picture is the involvement of that sleepless memo maniac David O. Selznick. With Gone with the Wind inching towards release, he moved forward on an adaptation, or as he put it 'picturization', of Daphne du Maurier's much-loved classic Rebecca. Selznick was as intrusive as a producer gets, managing to stay on top of the production even through the Gone with the Wind preparation which took up almost all of his time. It is easy to under-appreciate what Selznick contributed to Rebecca, even though Hitchcock purists may see the final product as damaged goods. This new Blu-Ray reminds us of the singular combination of Selznick's prestige, Hitchcock's recurring themes and embedded psychology and du Maurier's sumptuously enticing exploration of the Gothic.Revisiting the film, in more pristine shape than ever before, allows us to take in Rebecca in all its glory, and even its limitations. Selznick had an unrelenting sense of grandeur and a lavishness with which he strove to do justice to a book he near-worshiped. This comes to serve Rebecca well, most prominently with Manderlay. The mansion is so imposing in its physical representation of the suffocating spirit of the deceased Rebecca that it becomes a central character. The first Mrs. De Winter and Selznick are united in their paralleled enduring influence that seeps into every scene.As contradictory as Hitchcock and Selznick's agendas seem, they inadvertently coalesce to create something mostly harmonious. As far as Hitchcock goes, he also had a strong connection to the book, wanting to buy the rights earlier but not having the money to do so. Here, he gets to astonish with his lusciously multi-layered compositions. The lighting in particular is something to behold, alone begging repeat viewings with its majesty.The mogul's insistence on a conventionally faithful adaptation provides a basis for Hitchcock to wield his inquiring camera into what is going on underneath it all. Selznick's top-of-the-line template doesn't hurt either. He pokes and pries, peeling back the layers as Joan Fontaine treks into the nightmare world of Manderlay. Again, Rebecca solidifies Hitchcock's unmatched control, all the more impressive for working on a production as big as this.The performances remain a varied bunch, from Laurence Olivier's constantly brooding and callous Maxim to the ever-reliable character actors Nigel Bruce, Reginald Denny and Florence Bates. Joan Fontaine is aware of herself every moment in her first starring role and Hitchcock uses that to showcase the character's vulnerability and at times frustrating naiveté. She is a fragile stranger in a strange land, both on and off screen, and it appropriately looks like she could crumble any minute. All apprehensive eyebrows and second-guessing, Fontaine shines because she natural exudes a quality that she herself seems unaware of.It is of course Judith Anderson whose performance has more than held up over the decades. Her Mrs. Danvers is one of mostly passive and increasingly apparent insanity. She exists entirely in her own world, a heightened past broken up with patches of lucid denial and resentment. Anderson's spacy passion makes for a justifiably iconic villain. There is the moment when Rebecca realizes that Mrs. Danvers is not completely sane. The camera stays with the horrified unnamed protagonist as she moves away to deal with said realization, leaving Mrs. Danvers in the background, carrying on in her own world. That scene and moment express all, remaining as creepy as ever.The final twenty minutes is largely where Rebecca falters. We see the baggage lifted between Maxim and our The Second Mrs. De Winter, and they are allowed to connect freely, banding together against Rebecca's hold on posthumous hold on them. This is all well and fine, but at this point the story itself becomes laborious. Hitchcock can only do so much to alleviate the shortcomings found here. Thankfully, George Sanders' slimy presence is always a welcome treat.The extras on Rebecca carry over from a previous DVD edition and are more than satisfying in their abundant quantity, largely supporting a contextual view of the film via the Hitchcock and Selznick collaboration. Richard Schickel's commentary is pretty basic and his views of the film appear to be largely lukewarm. 'The Making of Rebecca' and 'The Gothic World of Daphne du Maurier' further expand on adding contextualization. Also included are radio plays of the story, an isolated music and effects track, interviews with Hitchcock and, my personal favorite, original screen tests with Margaret Sullavan and Vivien Leigh.Rebecca may not be a 'pure' Hitchcock film, lacking in his trademark acidic humor, and balancing out the expectations of another formidable force. Yet it remains one of my favorite Hitchcock films (indeed I far prefer it over Notorious) for its Gothic psychological thriller that seamlessly weaves in and out of an amalgam of other genres; the woman's picture, melodrama, romance, mystery and horror, to name some. The Blu-Ray offers a stellar picture with very little grain and minimal kinks; it is a more than worthy purchase to make for one of the master's largely exemplary works.",25 June 2023

The story has well developed and interesting characters, such as her Mrs. De Winter, his Maxim, and others among whom I may highlight flamboyant Mrs. Van Hopper and creepy Mrs. Danvers. However, an unique element is the strong presence of another character who is indeed absent: the Rebecca from the title, previous Mrs. De Winter. Probably, this is the most striking presence of a character who is only mentioned in the whole history of cinema.

Gene Hackman's little Bill is a man who projects raw power and toughness, he's so macho that he even builds his own house too. A man who likes to get his hands dirty then.Unforigven though is also a deconstruction of the western genre, with it's tropes, folklore and hearsay.

The realism extends down to the weaponry the characters use, bullets often miss their mark & guns are prone to jam.There's lots of character development but the story is almost the opposite of a redemption story. The plot isn't based around personal revenge or anything like that either for our 3 killers, they're doing it for the money and that's it. Clint Eastwood's characters instance that he'll be able to carry out his mission without reverting back to his nasty old self is very much thrown into doubt.

",4,"""Unforgiven"" falls into the category of revisionist Westerns, aiming to offer a more realistic and intricate portrayal of the American West, in stark contrast to the previous romanticized and fictional depictions of the frontier. However, the revisionist approach, while attempting to reflect reality, occasionally tips the scales by overemphasizing violence and exaggerating elements for the sake of storytelling. This inclination to depict the West as excessively violent may not necessarily mirror the everyday experiences of the majority of individuals living in that time and place, where life revolved around survival, farming, ranching, and community building.In the setting of ""Unforgiven,"" the 1880 small town of Big Whiskey, Wyoming, hardly harbors a virtuous soul. One-dimensional characters populate the narrative, and the only women featured are prostitutes. The plot is propelled by an incident involving these women. Two cowboys visit the brothel, and one of them gruesomely disfigures a prostitute with a knife.In an unlikely twist, the prostitutes pool their savings and put out the word that they seek a contract killer to exact revenge on the cowboys. They hire The Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett), a young braggart who claims to have killed five men, though it's questionable. He then seeks out the central character, reformed killer William Munny, played by Clint Eastwood, a man with a criminal past who miraculously remains a free man.Will Munny, however, obsessively fixates on his late wife's positive influence throughout the film, turning his reminiscing into an annoying and distracting narrative element. With his farm facing financial struggles and two young children to care for, he agrees to the Schofield Kid's offer, yet leaves his kids to fend for themselves while he embarks on this perilous journey.Munny reconnects with his former partner in crime, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman), but it's somewhat puzzling that screenwriter David Webb Peoples doesn't explore racial dynamics in Ned's character, considering he's a black man in the 19th century.The film's antagonist, Sheriff ""Little Bill"" Daggett (Gene Hackman), stands in stark contrast to Munny with his sadistic tendencies. Little Bill brutally beats the chauvinistic English Bob (Richard Harris), a troublemaker previously employed by the railroads.While Harris delivers a commendable performance, his character isn't seamlessly integrated into the plot, existing primarily to illustrate Little Bill's proclivity for violence. English Bob also serves up a source of comic relief through his hired novelist, W. W. Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek), who ends up working for Little Bill and transcribing his memoirs.The unrelenting violence takes center stage, with Munny eventually confronting Little Bill after he tortures and kills Ned. It's worth mentioning that Munny fulfills the contract by killing the two cowboys, a choice that turns him into an unlikable vigilante, although screenwriter Peoples doesn't seem to see it that way.""Unforgiven"" might not be as problematic if it weren't for its ponderous editing, which results in an exceedingly slow-paced narrative. Clint Eastwood, who also directed the film, shoulders much of the responsibility for its glacial pacing.The performances in ""Unforgiven"" are hindered by the one-dimensional characters, with Eastwood delivering a somewhat monotonous performance.

Written by David Webb Peoples, ""Unforgivable"" presents delicious dialogues that are consistent with the universe of those characters, opening space for moments of comic relief in the conversations between Munny and Ned (highlight for Ned's curiosity to know how Munny makes up for the lack of sex after his wife's death), reinforced by Munny's difficulty mounting and Kid's aimless shooting (""You shot all creation,"" complains Ned). Obviously, the empathy between Freeman and Eastwood collaborates a lot and makes that friendship believable, as we can see, for example, in the conversation by the fire about what Ned misses, which still indicates that Kid is lying, saying, without much conviction, who has already killed 5 men (and here it is worth highlighting Woolvett's performance, conveying this feeling of insecurity through his unconvincing speech). But the main theme of the film is the deconstruction of several western clichés and myths, in addition to the constant ""flirting"" with death and the certainty that it is not easy to take someone's life. Basically, the film preaches that pulling the trigger is not for everyone, so men with the necessary coldness at this moment become legends and are rarities (something that will also be reflected in the sensational climax of the narrative). Of course, there are also legends created at random, romanticized by those who tell the story and allow themselves ""some creative freedom"", as the writer Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek) says. Better than anyone else, he represents Hollywood's glamorized vision of the western that Eastwood wants to deconstruct. For Clint, life in the wild west wasn't all that pretty.Beautifully photographed by Jack N. Green, Unforgiven is, in its look, a Western with a capital F. Even deconstructing several western concepts, Eastwood does not forget to place his ""heroes"" riding in the distance, with only their silhouettes appearing. This is just one of many scenes capriciously captured by Jack N. Green's photography, which accurately captures the beautiful landscapes, with many scenes under the sunset and even under the rain (which reinforces the melancholy of the narrative). . In addition, the various night scenes, always lit with candles and lamps, have a beautiful look, quite dark and consistent with the bitterness of those characters. Also worthy of praise is the art direction team, which builds an impeccable Old West town through the precise architecture of the town of ""Big Whiskey"", reinforced by Janice Blackie-Goodine's costumes, which follow the western pattern with the boots, leather and hats (with emphasis on the striking Eastwood hat, which harks back to the spaghetti western days).The beautiful soundtrack by Lennie Niehaus is unforgettable, with its delicate and nostalgic theme song undergoing some variations that illustrate the feelings of the characters, such as when William, after being beaten by Bill, thinks he is going to die and shows regret for everything he has done (and in both scenes, the look carried by the shadows conveys the character's distress). The good sound work is noticeable not only in the remarkable shots and thunder, but also through subtle noises, such as the sound of the trigger being pulled or the crickets in the field, and the delicious rhythm of the feature is a merit of Joel Cox's editing, which intersperses contemplative moments in front of beautiful landscapes and moments of high tension. In addition, it makes elegant transitions, such as when Munny wakes up and discovers that he has been sick for 3 days or when a prostitute says that ""the rain is coming"", also announcing the arrival of Munny, Ned and Kid, who were galloping in the rain minutes before. All this excellent technical work serves as support for the excellent cast of ""Unforgiven"" to build, under the direction of the competent Eastwood, bitter and complex characters.Starting with one of the legends of the west, played by the always charismatic Richard Harris. Closely accompanied by the curious writer Beauchamp, Bob ""English"" is the typical outlaw who made fame in the West, but the way things happen deconstructs this image of the ""myth"" before the writer and the spectator, especially when Bill tells the true story of Corky's murder ""Two Guns"". The legends are being created based on exaggerations, as when Kid says that the man cut off the eyes, ears and breasts of the prostitute, which leads the Kid himself to doubt that Munny could be beaten by Bill, claiming that his gun ""probably "" it locked. Gene Hackman, on the other hand, composes a cruel and ruthless Little Bill, capable of kicking a dangerous thug out of the city, delivering a loaded gun into the hands of a prisoner and beating a captured killer to death. On the other hand, he shows pity when he catches the man who cut up a prostitute (""They're just cowboys who screwed up"") and at various times he seems to just want to live in peace in his new home - and Hackman is very competent in oscillating between moments of fury and the character's moments of serenity accurately. It is also worth mentioning his exceptional performance in the tense conversation he has with Beauchamp and Bob in prison, when he talks about the necessary coldness to kill someone (something that will have a direct reflection in the third act of the narrative, when only he and Munny fit into this situation). The duo Harris and Hackman still live one of the great moments of the feature, when Bill interrogates and searches Bob, then assaulting him under the incredulous gaze of the entire city, in an attempt to maintain control of the situation and, at the same time, send a message. Message to all the murderers in the region (""No one will come"", says one of the worried prostitutes). Unfortunately for Bill, the message never reached William Munny.Always firm, Eastwood convinces in the role of the veteran who returns to active duty only to get enough money to raise his children with more dignity. Your William Munny carries the weight of the past in his sad face and the weight of age is also evident, for example, in his difficulty to mount his horse. After a dark past, Munny is now a careful father, who avoids talking about the past in front of the children and even corrects his son when he hears a bad word (""Be careful how he says it""). His wife Claudia really changed his life, as he makes clear in phrases like ""It was the whiskey that made me that way. My wife cured me of drunkenness and wickedness."" He is no longer a murderer, has stopped drinking whiskey and now cares about his reputation, something that is evident every time someone mentions his past (""I'm not like that anymore"") and when he turns down a prostitute, in a touching and touching scene. Beautiful (""I admire you for being faithful to your wife""). But Claudia was no longer present and now he was back in that life, even if he didn't admit it, as his disapproving look indicates when he hears from his friend Ned that ""if Claudia were alive, he wouldn't be doing that"". But unlike in the past, now William immediately feels the weight of what he did after killing a man, and Eastwood demonstrates the character's discomfort well, playing with a pebble while looking down sadly and shouting for water to the dying boy, like this like Freeman also illustrates Ned's discomfort through his suffering countenance.Upon discovering that Ned was beaten to death by Bill, William Munny's old killer instinct comes to the fore, something illustrated in a small gesture of the character, who picks up the whiskey bottle and takes many sips. The empty bottle, lying in the mud in the rain, indicates that the old killer is back and the sensational ending of ""Unforgiven"" begins when his rifle interrupts the celebrations of Little Bill and his friends at the bar. The dialogue that precedes the shooting is a great tribute to the genre that made Eastwood famous, filled with striking phrases like ""I've killed women and children. I've already killed everything that walks and crawls and I'm here to kill you Little Bill for what you did to Ned"" (notice the glint in Beauchamp's eyes when he heard the phrase and realized that he was facing a true legend). This type of catchphrase was traditional in the western. The shooting that follows is a synthesis of everything the film preaches, showing that it is not easy to pick up a gun and shoot a man. For this reason, while Munny lands practically all of his shots, the others shoot in any direction, without direction, or run away, afraid of a real killer. The anthological finale, with Munny and Bill scheduling to meet each other in hell is fabulous.And all the glories of this film were deserved, as it managed to give a dignified end to a genre that was in its last breaths, which would probably end up being forgotten. Eastwood merits, star of the genre, who with this film paid homage to the western, and, consciously, also made the will of the same. As well illustrated by the simple sentence that closes ""The Unforgivable"", even a cruel killer can change his behavior next to a person who is worth it. If nothing explained to Mrs. Feathers why her daughter married a violent and merciless man, the feature explains how a man marked by violent roles can, over the years, display such sensitivity and deliver us works as mature as this excellent one"" Unforgiven"".",6 September 2023

",10,"Cynical is a word that's been used to describe virtually all of Billy Wilder's movies, but in the case of ACE IN THE HOLE, a more appropriate adjective might be ""corrosive"". The writing on ACE IN THE HOLE is just as pungent as any other script of his, but this one has an extremely sour aftertaste, as if Wilder lost all faith in the better angels of our nature. On SUNSET BOULEVARD he explored the dark side of Hollywood, but with ACE IN THE HOLE he not only skewers the fourth estate but also a gullible public that eagerly laps up what passes for news.Billy Wilder based his film on the real-life saga of Floyd Collins, a Kentucky man who, in 1925, was trapped in a cave following a landslide. A Louisville reporter covering the story dispatched article after article to a nation sitting on pins and needles, and ultimately won himself a Pulitzer Prize for his work. Whether that newspaperman was the inspiration for ACE's antihero Chuck Tatum is not certain, but Wilder used his own creation to illustrate how people can be manipulated towards their worst tendencies.Chuck Tatum is a disgraced reporter looking to rejuvenate his career after being employed by ~and fired from~ no less than half a dozen newspapers. I use the verb ""rejuvenate"" as opposed to ""redeem"" because Tatum is not a man with any redeemable qualities....nor is he looking for any redemption.Not being the intrepid Woodward or Bernstein type, he's more National Enquirer, only concerned with sensationalistic human interest stories that will boost circulation. But Tatum has burned so many bridges in the past that he's been practically exiled to New Mexico; no major outlet wants anything to do with him. Whether or not Tatum was intending to pass through the Land of Enchantment, car trouble and meager funds force him to settle in Albuquerque.Making his way to the Sun-Bulletin, a small-time paper, Tatum offers his services at a bargain rate to Jacob Boot, the editor and founder. As he tells him, ""I'm a $250 a week newspaperman, Mr Boot. You can have me for $50"". Boot is the type of man Tatum normally looks down on with contempt: an old-fashioned newsman who believes that integrity is a currency that should never be devalued. He's Walter Cronkite to Tatum's Bill O'Reilly.Nevertheless, Tatum takes the job and whiles away his stretch in what he refers to as a sunbaked Siberia, dreaming of the scoop that will take him back to the big time. A whole year passes before that opportunity arrives when Tatum and Herbie Cook, a Jimmy Olsen type of cub reporter, are assigned to cover a rattlesnake hunt in the desert.Pulling over to refuel at a gas station owned by Leo and Lorraine Minosa, Tatum learns that Leo, a part-time relic hunter, is trapped inside a cave after the dwelling's roof collapses. The county sheriff is too busy campaigning for re-election to pry himself over, but his deputy is on the scene. Ignoring the junior lawman's orders, Tatum takes a flashlight and camera with him into the cave, making a perilous crawl through unstable tunnels until finally reaching Leo.Unable to move because his legs are pinned by heavy rocks, Minosa cannot be approached at all because the crawlspace is too small for any human to squirm through. The only way to get water and food to him is with a long stick. Sensing the scoop of a lifetime, Tatum buddies up to Leo, getting to know every detail about his new best friend before promising him that help is on the way.Leo's parents, who live with him and their daughter-in-law behind the store, offer their own room as Tatum's personal ground zero while he sends newspaper articles ~often two a day~ about Minosa's predicament out on the wires. Very quickly, the story becomes a local, then a state and national, media obsession as people flock to the site to watch the drilling crew attempt to rescue Leo. Tatum's bottom feeding competitors arrive to exploit the situation; a train calling itself the Minosa Special shuttles passengers from all over the place to converge on what has now become a carnival atmosphere.... literally! Even a Ferris wheel has been set up! 😣If the morbid curiosity seekers weren't enough to test your faith, then Tatum will take it a notch further. He secretly plots to delay Leo's rescue as long as possible in order to increase newspaper circulation ~and entice the big cities' attention. Tatum and the corrupt sheriff make a Faustian bargain where, in exchange for keeping his rival reporters away from Minosa, Tatum will help the venal lawman win re-election. The contractor hired for the job assures them that Leo can be freed in 12 hours, 24 at the most, by shoring up the cavern walls. But Tatum and the sheriff bully him into using a huge drill instead, which will take longer....by several unnecessarily costly days.It's tough to find a redeeming character in ACE IN THE HOLE because everyone except for the incorruptible Jacob Boot falls under Tatum's toxic spell, including the wet-behind-the-ears Herbie. Even tomb raider Leo Minosa is not above reproach since, technically, he was removing Native American artifacts from sacred ground. I should point out that there was one other person whom Tatum never corrupted: Lorraine. She was already morally destitute long before meeting him. It would be tempting to compare her to Lady Macbeth, but at least the Scottish noblewoman supported her husband. Lorraine refuses to pose for a photo op at a church because, and I quote, ""kneeling bags my nylons"". Wow!! With a spouse like her, who needs Delilah?Douglas delivers an assertive performance as the ethically challenged Chuck Tatum. Prior to ACE IN THE HOLE, traditional movie reporters were represented by wisecracking types such as Clark Gable or Jimmy Stewart. Tatum, on the other hand, is an amoral insect with little to no respect for his fellow human beings, unless he stands to benefit from it. If he were around today, he'd be working for Fox News or some sleazy tabloid show ~like there's a difference between the two!😏Commercially and critically, ACE IN THE HOLE didn't dazzle everyone the way SUNSET BOULEVARD did, which is a shame because I think it's just as good. Wilder held up a mirror to the public, showing them what even fair-minded people are capable of when an unscrupulous person knows how to push their buttons. When we all drive on the highway, our natural impulse upon observing an accident on the other side of the divider is to slow down and gawk....and that's what Wilder was tapping into.It took a long time for me to see ACE IN THE HOLE because legal issues compelled Paramount to bury it, and they never released it on home videocassette. Today it's available on Dvd, and Paramount has now rectified their wrong by making ACE IN THE HOLE accessible for streaming online. If you haven't seen this misunderstood gem, then you owe it to yourself to watch it at your earliest convenience. 🔚",15 April 2023

His work is legendary because he fearlessly dove into any genre, took whatever material he was given and calibrated it for maximum punch, striking the funny bone just as often as the heart. Unjustly dismissed when it was first released, this has undergone a much deserved reevaluation in the years since and, perhaps most distressing, has turned out to be not only prescient but continually relevant.As long as the Chuck Tatums of the world exist, so too will the seemingly fluid and even abstract nature of the truth, and all the ways it can be bent - or broken.",7 April 2023
rw9288404,ur169150736,tt0105695," A scathing review of the brutality of the west
",8,"TL; DR Good Movie go watch it.Unforgiven is not only a Movie but a brilliant representation of the glorification and justification of violence in the media. The film does not shy away from the savagery of the abuse received by the character of English Bob. The character, though useless, is the representation of the belief of romance and whimsy of the old west. The scribe of English bob, W. W Beachamp, follows this belief until the brutality is truly revealed to him. However, the morbid curiosity of man leads to W. W Beachamp following the character of Little Bill Daggett, The cruel and barbaric sheriff of the town. This man is a representation of the cold-blooded nature of the old west. The main character in this film is William Munny, an ex-outlaw who has regret for his actions. The character of the Scoville kid serves as a newcomer into the violence of the old west. A man who has always been tempted by the idea of the romance of tracking down outlaws. However, as he learns later in the movie, taking another's life is hardly romantic, more tragic. The movie shares multiple similarities with Homer's Iliad with the character William Munny being the character of Achilles. Both suffer the death of their best male friend, neither wanting to kill but after suffering the death of their best friend, both extract revenge by killing those responsible ignoring the morals that brought them there in the first place, however a key difference between Homer's Iliad and Unforgiven is Achilles was fated to die at the end of the trojan war whereas Clint Eastwoods character escapes, seemingly escaping his fate. This film contrasts the cockiness and extroverted nature of much of his
previous roles, here he seems tired and done with life, a show of how the life of an actor has affected him. The film seems like a personal story to him like birdman for Michael Keaton or elemental for that other guy.",28 August 2023

",9,"In a world where the trades are able to get away with publishing nasty stories about celebrity breakups or political trades smear their opponents with loony nonsense, Billy Wilder's cynical, dark 1951 picture Ace in the Hole could not be more relevant in the modern world. Wilder spares no one in his biting, satirical portrayal of the American media institution, which may be a reason why the film received unfair negative reviews upon release. The good guys are the victims while the media and the public are the bad guys. Of course, the trades are the one who writes such sensational journalism. But who eats these stories up? The public! The public absolutely love the celebrity gossip or the next big tragedy. Much hasn't changed since 1951. In fact, with the advent of social media, sensation in the news has gotten way worse. Wilder's film is a tightly edited narrative with a strong screenplay and an excellent, fierce performance from Kirk Douglas.Coming off the heels of Sunset Boulevard, Wilder was ready for the next big thing. With such a juicy story, there is no way he could have failed, right? Unfortunately, you would be wrong surmising such thoughts. Not only did it receive poor reviews upon release, but it was also labeled box office poison. Paramount changed the title to ""The Big Carnival"" to get more butts in the seats, but that ultimately failed. The studio took a portion of Wilder's cut from his next film to make up for the box office failure. I believe the media was tepid towards the film because Wilder went after everyone and did not hold back. Contemporary critics are much more favorable to the point where it can be considered an all-time classic. The easy way to view the narrative is to hold back any bias which can be an impossible thing. The story itself was inspired by tragic true events. Floyd Collins was trapped in a Kentucky cave and a reporter used the event to create a national sensation earning himself a Pulitzer Prize. The other event took place in 1949 when a young girl fell in a well in California and thousands of people showed up just to see what would happen. Both people died. I also think the film is incorrectly labeled a film-noir. Yes, there are some elements of the genre here, but I think it is just a film about poor journalism.Charles Tatum (Kirk Douglas) is a very skilled reporter who has been fired from eleven major East Coast media outlets for various issues such as alcoholism. After a car accident in Albuquerque, New Mexico, he cons the local media office for a job that would help him return to the East Coast. His big break comes a year later when the owner of a trading post gets trapped in a cave. Tatum uses this opportunity to help him better his future. He realizes that the man could be rescued within a day but he comes up with a different plan of rescue so he can milk the story for as long as he can. This becomes a national media sensation as people from all over go to the desert to see everything happen with their own eyes. Here comes the cue for the popcorn and cotton candy vendors. Tatum has a problem on hand when he discovers that the owner's not-so-loving wife, Lorraine (Jan Sterling) has been taking cash from the register and is planning to ditch her husband. Not if Charles has anything to say about that!Kirk Douglas is known for his good-guy roles, but he can put on a ferocious face when needed. This is one of his most savage, bitter roles. He truly sunk his teeth deep into the material and ran away with it. It was great watching him con the public (and the corrupt sheriff) with the trapped man, but I think even more impressive is the scenes where he conned the newspaper office into handing him a job. Jan Sterling also delivers a strong performance. She might have my favorite quote in the entire film, the one about why she doesn't go to church.Ace in the Hole is a scornful, bitter film about the shoddiness of sensational journalism. Everyone likes a happy ending, but do not go looking for that here (Joseph Breen of the Hay's Code might have done a thing or two about that). Still, the events of this story is what happens often in the world today...when the media decides to make a huge story about nothing in the name of profit or bettering their careers. The film hit me straight on as Wilder makes no attempt to be subtle. There is a reason why I can't digest trades such as ""US Weekly"" whose only goal is to make a buck or two by spreading gossip about celebrities. Behind Wilder's masterful direction, Douglas's excellent performance, and great screenplay and editing, this film is another must-see from Billy Wilder's filmography.My Grade: A-",15 March 2023

In other words, if there's no news, I make it myself.The big difference with J. J. Hunsecker (Burt Lancaster) from ""Sweet smell od success"" is that Hunsucker writes about celebrities.

Dr. Shirley wishes to tour and perform in the Deep South during the Segregation period, which provides many different challenges.

The message of this movie is what makes it truly special and heartwarming.While this film pulls no punches when exploring both subtle and overt racism, it also shows that people from vastly different backgrounds can come together and become friends, despite the world's insistence on preventing just that. Although Mortensen's character is loud-mouthed, abrasive, and oftentimes an outright glutton, Dr. Shirley also has his own flaws (holier than thou demeanor, giving unwanted lectures, etc.). Despite beginning the journey in a rough manner, the two become close friends by the end of the tour, even improving each other in areas where they were most stubborn. By the end of the movie, each was willing to sacrifice his own needs, to help the other. This shows the power of looking beneath the surface of a person's shortcomings, which is applicable in any time period.

",10,"Title: ""Green Book: A Harmony of Friendship and Social Commentary""In the tapestry of cinematic storytelling, ""Green Book"" stands as a poignant masterpiece that harmonizes the complexities of friendship against the backdrop of racial inequality. Directed by Peter Farrelly, this film unfolds as a compelling narrative inspired by true events, offering a resonant exploration of human connection and societal challenges.Set in the early 1960s, ""Green Book"" introduces us to Tony Vallelonga, an Italian-American bouncer with a penchant for solving problems with his fists. When the Copacabana, where Tony works, undergoes renovations, he finds himself in need of alternative employment. Enter Dr. Don Shirley, a highly accomplished African-American pianist embarking on a concert tour in the Deep South. Hired as Dr. Shirley's driver and protector, Tony is thrust into a journey that transcends geographical boundaries, unraveling the layers of prejudice and ignorance.Viggo Mortensen's portrayal of Tony Vallelonga is a revelation. Mortensen captures the essence of Tony's transformation from a man driven by stereotypes to one who confronts his own biases, delivering a performance that balances humor and depth. Mahershala Ali, in the role of Dr. Don Shirley, brings a quiet dignity to his character, navigating the complexities of being a talented, sophisticated musician in a society that refuses to see beyond the color of his skin.The heart of ""Green Book"" lies in the evolving camaraderie between Tony and Dr. Shirley. The eponymous ""Green Book"" refers to a guide for African-American travelers, listing establishments where they would be welcome during an era of segregation. This symbolic roadmap becomes the physical and metaphorical bridge that connects the two protagonists, transcending racial and societal divides. The chemistry between Mortensen and Ali is the film's driving force, portraying a genuine friendship that defies the prejudices of the time.The screenplay, co-written by Farrelly, Brian Hayes Currie, and Nick Vallelonga (Tony Vallelonga's real-life son), strikes a delicate balance between humor and social commentary. The film doesn't shy away from addressing the harsh realities of racial discrimination but uses Tony's unfiltered perspective to inject humor, making the narrative accessible without undermining its serious undertones.The cinematography by Sean Porter captures the landscapes of the Deep South with both beauty and unease. From the opulence of concert halls to the harsh realities of roadside motels, each frame contributes to the storytelling, emphasizing the stark contrasts of the racially divided America of that era.Music plays a pivotal role in ""Green Book,"" reflecting the characters' emotional journeys. The soundtrack, featuring a blend of classical, jazz, and popular music, underscores the cultural differences and commonalities between Tony and Dr. Shirley. The musical performances, particularly those by Mahershala Ali, add another layer of authenticity to the film's portrayal of the transformative power of art.While ""Green Book"" received acclaim for its performances and storytelling, it also faced criticism for its approach to tackling the issue of racism. Some argued that the film oversimplified the complexities of systemic discrimination, while others praised it for using a more accessible narrative to broach the subject.In conclusion, ""Green Book"" is a triumph of storytelling that navigates the delicate terrain of friendship and racial tension. Through the prism of a real-life journey, the film addresses societal issues with humor, heart, and a profound sense of humanity. It invites the audience to reflect on the enduring power of connection and the capacity of individuals to overcome prejudices. ""Green Book"" is more than a movie; it's a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and a reminder that understanding and compassion can emerge even in the most challenging of circumstances.",15 December 2023

It pulls a trick to achieve this, deliberately skipping the hard moments and only showing the aftermaths, stripping it from too much drama.The camera just never loses sight of either of our friends, and that makes it an exceptionally good film.

Family, racism and acceptation. The movie is settled back in the old time America were the blacks rights were better, but still on a low quality. Including the important things they talk about, it was very funny, too. The jokes were fun and intelligent, and they included some very nice ironic sentences. The story is very holding, it is almost like reading a book, with different chapters. Every chapter, was one city where the duo was on a concert. And they were driving and driving, and sooner you got longer into things, you are getting more about The Pianist and his backstory, and why he is so uptight and serious all the time. About the technicals. The pictures and scenography did really the job with some retro atmosphere, as well as some good songs, including some very old symphonies too, that is definitely a fun thing to listen for musicians. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali were both great and put power into their role, and they did their job great! Concluding everything, Green Book is more than just a green book, it is a story of two different persons that meet each other, with a completely misunderstanding, but later on, they show how you can be a good person and that you must open yourself to show who you really are.

Too ""Freudian"", multilayered/fragile and insane for that time era. Of course he steals the show. Charisma wise, there are not many comparable actors with him.It's not only Cagney. WHITE HEAT has a great plot. Many intense scenes, non stop action and original. Of course it's a bit outdated and today's audiences won't feel that this grab you by the throat. Still, even today, viewer will feel anxiety and agony watching these characters doing what they do.I can't rate it higher because there is zero verisimilitude here, to be honest.

The film holds onto a few features of it's previous one, the grainy look, the bad dubbing, the frayed and worn costumes, the low and interesting camera angles, another great introduction to Eastwood's character who this time enters a saloon on a rainy night to retrieve his prize, he's a cold and detached character who doesn't mind blowing a few men away to get rich. The punch effects are still over the top like someone breaking a table in half or something, the film retains though a real rough unpolished look which combines well with it's stylish music and action. The music is good in this one again and there's even a little organ music too which surprised me. The film is still low budget but I loved the costumes, the landscape and the dry humour in the film. The picture is widescreen and the blu ray comes with good picture and sound quality. Eastwood continues to fascinate as this tall handsome strange man with no past. This is not a gory film, in fact some characters are shot dead at point blank range with no blood. Eastwood sort of takes a bit of a backseat in this film though, Lee Van Cleef is really great in his role and the one they end up going after together is a real villain. There is one scene though that's really poor where a woman who's being attacked by a man in bed shoots herself when she could quite easily have killed him instead which you think might have been more likely but there you go.

",6,"For A Few Dollars More (2?) (1965) -In a fight my money was on Lee Van Cleef as Colonel Douglas Mortimer. He was definitely the better character in this film, although I did like the interactions between him and Clint Eastwood as Monco.I would have liked to have seen more scuffles and action in it though. It all seemed to be saved up for the end, which caused it to drag a bit, especially for someone who wouldn't choose a western as their first genre to watch, although with that said, I have been surprised by a number of them lately and I actually thought that this one had the better story and delivery over 'The Good, The Bad And The Ugly' (1966), which is the one that tends to appear on more of the top film lists.Some of the supporting characters were a bit corny and badly dubbed, which let things down somewhat, but Gian Maria Volontè was quite sexy in his role of El Indio. His stoned out weirdness was really hard to deal with however and didn't necessarily add to his part.It took a long time to really get in to things with the story. By the time Clint and Lee met and decided to work together and then went after their bounty, I felt that it had been a whole film already, not for the content, but for the length of the set up.I was glad that there wasn't a larger romantic element though, because I find that can ruin a good cowboy film. I did wish that there had been more action and less of the ""Drama"" however, because the two lead characters would have lent themselves more to that sort of gunslinging and body count type of film, rather than the buddy picture that this almost turned in to.Finally I would say that some of the background music was absolutely awful and went right through me. It was incredibly piercing at times and not really that necessary at all.It wasn't a bad film of its type and I preferred Clint here than in some of his others. When 'Magnificent Seven' (1960) was remade in 2016, I wondered if we would see a plethora of western revival's and I certainly felt that this story would be worth a revisit, just with a slight polish and a modern look at delivering it as something artistic and thoughtful instead of something churned out for box office figures.617.89/1000.",22 September 2023

But Monco and him also don't completelly trust each other and Monco wants to go his own way at some point, while the Colonel wants to keep working together. At that moment Monco probably wanted to go alone because he didn't want to share the bounty, but at the end of the film it is revealed Mortimer's motive was vengeance for his sister.In beginning of the film the bounty hunters come over as mainly egocentrical in their motive. But later in the film they turn in the morally good ones. This is on one hand by Indio's extreme cruelty. On the other hand by revealing of the Colonel's motive being vengeance for his sister and him letting Monco keep all the money and Monco in turn offering the Colonel his part.The acting in the film is very good, Clint Eastwood and Lee van Cleef have the perfect looks and manner for this kind of film.Also the wife of the hotel owner who likes Monco is perfectly cast.The cinematography is excellent.

But his stories have also had a significant impact on movies and TV shows, especially in the film noir genre. Hammett's most famous work was probably ""The Maltese Falcon"" from 1930. Here the public met the private detective Sam Spade for the first time. In him the world came across the archetype of the hard-drinking, hard-hitting, tough-talking gumshoe.In 1941 an odd group of people started filming ""The Maltese Falcon"". John Huston had never directed before, Humphrey Bogart only used to play heavies in supporting roles and for 61-year-old Sidney Greenstreet it was the first time he appeared in a feature what-so-ever. But the executives at Warner Brothers weren't worried. The studio regarded the production as a typical B-movie. A cheap detective flick to run out in some of the country's small, insignificant theaters.Despite the fact that many of the people involved were so new to the game, the production flowed along at a rapid pace. This was largely due to the fact that Huston had scripted every scene and camera angle before photography began. The whole thing actually went so smoothly that the cast and their director could take long, leisurely lunches at a Country Club next to the Warner studio in Burbank.When ""The Maltese Falcon"" was released the response was so positive that the film instantly acquired A-status. It was quickly moved to bigger and better theaters. The movie also made Huston a respected director - and turned Humphrey Bogart into a star. The only one unhappy was Dashiell Hammett.

Well, folks, let me introduce you to John Huston's 1941 film The Maltese Falcon-the third adaptation of the same-name novel in a decade, and hands down, the best one.If you've always been skeptical of remakes, this film might make you reconsider. It's a cinematic gem that proves not all remakes are destined for mediocrity. Writing them off outright would mean missing out on this noir masterpiece.Set against the shadowy backdrop of film-noir, The Maltese Falcon is an early example of the genre's brilliance. Humphrey Bogart, known for his gangster roles, takes a departure and delivers a performance that's both gritty and nuanced. It's like seeing a familiar face in a new, captivating light.What struck me most is how the film unfolds its mystery. You don't even hear about the elusive falcon until well into the storyline. John Huston, who not only directed but co-wrote the script, pulls double duty with finesse. The result is a singular vision on screen that keeps you hooked from start to finish.The Maltese Falcon isn't just a remake; it's a reinvention that stands tall among its predecessors. So, the next time someone bemoans the state of Hollywood's obsession with remakes, throw this film into the conversation. It's a compelling argument that some remakes aren't just necessary-they're downright exceptional.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 9/10.Native 4K presentation, Detail level: Excellent, Colour reproduction: Excellent, Level accuracy: Excellent, Encode: Good, Master condition: ExcellentAUDIO: 9/10.DTS-HD MA 2.0 mono audio, Dialogue reproduction: Excellent, Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent, Dynamics: Good, Surround sound presentation: N/A, LFE content: N/AMOOFIEMETER: 8/10.",15 November 2023

Director John Huston embodied on the screen a classic story about mystery, intrigue and romance, creating an atmosphere in which it is impossible not to get involved.One of the main reasons why ""The Maltese Falcon"" has become a real cinematic gem is the unsurpassed cast. Humphrey Bogart as detective Sam Spade, along with Mary Astor as his mysterious client Bridget O'Shaughnessy, create amazing chemistry on the screen. The performance deserves the highest praise - their acting is full of energy, intrigue and unpredictability.The script of ""The Falcon"" skillfully mixes elements of a classic detective film with comedy features and subtle hints of romance. The story of the search for a valuable falcon and the relationship between the characters seems simple, but it strikes with its unpredictability and the development of the plot. The dialogues are masterfully constructed and full of humor, which makes the film unique and memorable.The visual style of the painting deserves a special mention. Houston creates an atmosphere of complete mystery, riddled with riddles. The black-and-white image enhances the effect of noir cinema, adding icy aesthetics and mystery to each scene. Lighting harmoniously combines with the characters and the environment, creating a game of shadows and shades, and the camera skillfully conveys the emotions and mood of the characters.The musical accompaniment in the film sets the viewer to the right mood - jazz perfectly combines with the action on the screen, giving it dynamism and passion. The selected music creates the atmosphere of the era and subtly conveys the emotional state of the characters.One of the main advantages of ""The Maltese Falcon"" is its time. The film skillfully works with the plot, characters and aesthetics of the 1940s, literally setting the genre outlines of that time. This desire for authenticity and aesthetics creates the impression of immersion in the past and allows the viewer to better enjoy every aspect of the painting.""The Maltese Falcon"" is certainly a memorable work that continues to be a milestone in cinema.

He's a director who made a range of films, and many of them are admirable... but I also find many of them kind of dry and boring in parts (Treasure of the Sierra Madre is maybe the only one I don't find slow in parts, for what that's worth).The Maltese Falcon followed Casablanca at the double feature I saw tonight, and Casablanca is so much sharper from a writing perspective, and much better paced. The Maltese Falcon really drags in parts, and I felt restless watching it to some extent. It's all about various people wanting the titular object, and I don't know - it really drags things out to some extent, and while I don't think it's visually flawed, nothing about the way it looks was consistently super exciting to me.That they got a feature-length film out of such a straightforward premise might be worth something, but the thing that does thankfully save The Maltese Falcon is the acting. Sidney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre (both were also in Casablanca) are good, but it's Bogart (also of course in Casablanca) who's amazing here, and considerably elevates something I'd otherwise consider pretty dry.

rw9283149,ur110212703,tt0033870," Beginning with a ripper of a noir
",8,"John Huston starts his directing career proper by creating a movie star in Humphrey Bogart. Bogart had been a supporting actor for WB for a few years (notably in things like Wyler's Dead End), but his turn as Sam Spade in the adaptation of the novel by Dashiell Hammett done by Huston himself put him on the cinematic map. And watching the film eight decades after its release (for the third or fourth time, to be honest), it's easy to see how he could capture the audience's attention in this sarcastic performance that glides through danger with ease. Throw in the mystery of a plot, and you've got a recipe for audience enjoyment.Sam Spade (Bogart) runs a private detective business with his partner Miles Archer (Jerome Cowan) when a woman under a false name (Mary Astor) comes in and asks them to track the man who has her sister. It turns out that this woman, Mrs. O'Shaughnessy, was lying about her reasons for following Floyd Thursby, and Sam finds out that night when both Miles and Thursby are murdered on the street half an hour apart. So begins Spade's search through a seedy underbelly of antique collection where no one says what they mean, and he has to sort through it all to find the truth, despite the unhelpful efforts of the police who want to lock him up for the murders. With the help of his secretary Iva (Gladys George), Sam stays one step ahead as best he can, especially when Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre) sticks him up to find information about some mysterious black bird figurine, starting Sam on the path to find Mr. Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet) who is also after it.The joys of the film are in the combination of the tricksy nature of the plot and Spade's cool approach to unraveling what he got dropped in the middle of. I think part of the appeal is that Spade is simply not emotionally connected to anyone or the Maltese Falcon itself. We get a nice rundown of the history from Mr. Gutman, and Spade just listens blithely like he doesn't really care. He's constantly acting invested one moment, pretending rage or investment, but then going back to being smug and almost entertained by what he sees and hears. It's all ridiculous, and Bogart plays Sam like a detached member of the audience to a certain degree.The film was obviously made on the cheap with almost half of the film and most of the final half hour taking place on a single set: Sam's apartment, but Huston makes the most of his camera, obviously having learned from Wyler on how to make his compositions interesting even in limited space. This especially becomes important in the final twenty-minutes or so where five people are in the living room of an apartment for almost the whole time, and Huston can pan his camera from left to right, getting all five into frame at different distances. It's not as complex or effortlessly accomplished as Wyler would have done it, but it is, nonetheless, well done.My only real issue with the film is that despite all of Spade's apparent detachment from all of the events in the film, there's this last-minute need for him to be invested in Mrs. O'Shaughnessy. There are tears as he makes his terrible decision to invite justice upon her for her crimes, and I just don't think it follows from what we learned about from Sam Spade up to that point. There's a nice reveal about his motive for getting deep into it, regarding what one does when one loses a partner, but I never felt much that Spade was actually falling for the woman. He was toying with her as much as he had been toying with Cairo or Gutman or slapping around Wilmer Cook (Elisha Cook Jr.), Gutman's right hand man, because he could and it entertained him while it got him closer to figuring out the answers at the center of the mystery.And that the mystery ends without a real conclusion, essentially Spade just closing one chapter in a larger adventure while talking about the Falcon being the stuff that dreams are made of is just kind of wonderful. That he's removed from the mystery because he doesn't actually care about the falcon provides this kind of distance to the manic behavior of the people he's dealing with that creates a better sense of fun in the tale.Huston entered the WB system as director in the early 40s, made a very fun and accomplished entry in their house style while applying the filmmaking lessons he'd learned from Wyler and keeping Hammett's storytelling intact. He bred a new movie star in the process and got his own directing career into a great opening state. The Maltese Falcon is a very good first film, and a fun movie in its own right.",26 August 2023

",10,"John Huston's second screenplay that he directed himself, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre feels closer to his heart than anything else he'd made up to this point which had all been within the Warner Brothers house style of, alternatively, noirish thrillers or women's pictures. Adapting the novel by B. Traven, Huston went to Mexico with his father and WB's biggest star to make a tale of desperation, greed, and murder that, for reasons unknown, did not excite the masses into making it a box office success. Weird, huh? Still, the film is great.Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) is a down and out American living on the streets of Tampico, Mexico. He meets a fellow drifter Bob (Tim Holt), and the two go out on a construction job for a shady American who promises them good pay but disappears when it comes time to deliver. This film feels different in these early sections from a lot of what was being made at the time, and it seems like it has a lot to do not only with the source material but also John Huston's hard-living lifestyle. There's a barfight between Dobbs, Bob, and the other American, and it is really harsh and brutal. It doesn't feel like any sort of Hollywood fight. The three get tired quickly. They hurt from the first blow. It ends with someone laying on the floor, gasping for air, and it feels like the whole thing was informed by barfights that both Huston and Bogart had been in before. This is a lived-in, grounded world, and into it we get a portrait of greedful madness.Flush with cash, the two decide to seek out an old prospector, Howard (Walter Huston), and to strike out into the Mexican countryside, far from the reaches of civilization, and go hunting for gold. The country they must get to in order to search for gold has to be untouched by modern civilization. If others have already gone there, then a large mining company will have already swooped in to take everything, so they have to go deep into the wilds of the Mexican countryside where the barrier between bandit rule and federale rule changes on the day and the hour.The trio manage to slip into the mountains without notice, find their vein, and start working diligently, pulling gold dust from the ground, working for months on end. The isolation and distance from civilization brings the worst out in them, mostly Dobbs. Paranoia begins to take Dobbs over, afraid that every time someone leaves a tent at night, they're looking for his stash of gold. Convinced that Howard deciding to send Dobbs off to town for supplies is an effort to get him killed by the bandits. If this section of the film lasted longer, I'd get tired of it, but I think it lasts just long enough to make it's point because things change when Bob goes into town and gets followed by another American, Cody (Bruce Bennett), with suspicions that Bob's story of being a hunter are cover for him being a prospector. Their suspicions escalate to the point where they are willing to commit murder to protect their find, only to be interrupted by the bandits led by Gold Hat (Alfonso Bedoya).The last half of the film is a balance of subtle tension as the trio have to deal with the threat of the bandits with their own efforts to finish up their work, with the internal tensions mounting again. All Dobbs really needs is one final push to bring his paranoia back, and Howard going off to help a sick local child is the exact sort of thing that does it for him. There is a steady decline in mental states and situations until what has happened to Howard's previous fortunes happens again.What makes this film special is that gritty visual feel that seeps into the very bones of everything that goes into its construction. The look of the film, from the beautiful locations in Mexico to the degrading look of the characters as they get deeper into their efforts to Huston's strong visual sense (again, inherited from his friend and mentor William Wyler) is all fantastic so that the film, from beginning to end, is just great to look at. The performances are all top notch and a real step up from the performances in Huston's previous films. Bogart shows his range as he takes Dobbs into complete madness. Huston got his Oscar for this film, and he's really good being the most John Huston of the characters, slightly detached, slightly sarcastic, and entirely materialistic in terms of how to live life. Holt has the largely thankless job as the straight man of the three, and he carries himself well. Bedoya has the fun role of Gold Hat, hamming it up every moment he's on screen.This is Huston's best film up to this point, and it feels like the most purely Huston film he made. That it inspired Sam Peckinpah to a large degree is no surprise since this and Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia could stand side by side in one of the most comfortable double-features in history. It's a tale of greed, paranoia, and madness, all done beautifully with everyone at the top of their game. That it did not inspire great box office returns isn't much of a surprise, though.

The score works excellently alongside the film, as it sucks you in, making you feel as if you're really there, sat in that grand theatre, gazing at Victoria Page's enchanting performance, and taking it all in. And the characters are fantastically written, as we get intimate knowledge of each of their ambitions and the way that they each try to pursue them. Lermontov is consistently focused solely on the success of his ballet company and sees other passions in life (especially love) as a distraction, whilst Craster & Page both find themselves between a rock and a hard place as they strive not only towards their respective careers, but also towards love, and each suffer terrible consequences as a result. Linking to this, I have to say the ending is utterly shocking, it will truly leave you feeling thunderstruck, but at the same time it sums up the movie so perfectly, and it's the main reason why I've given such a high rating because of that.However the reason I haven't given a 10/10 rating is due to the overly long 15-20 minute ballet sequence during Act 3. I know I'm definitely in the minority here as from what I've seen, a lot of people actually consider that part of the movie to be their favourite, but for me it was just too long.

Scheming on the sidelines is the cold impresario Lermontov, who not only lusts for Victoria Page but thinks she should abandon all for art.This movie features some dazzling dance scenes and wonderful music, but fritters away time on dull side characters, and badly stints on Vicky's character development.

",7,"The truth is that I liked The Red Shoes much more than I had expected, but my remaining doubts about the film were not entirely crushed after watching it. The Red Shoes has often been voted as one of the greatest films of all time and I can see why- it is unpredictable and entirely different from what appeared on screen around its time period. It is invigorating and stark both in its look and its story. The cinematographer Jack Cardiff has created a masterpiece of colour, shooting in an expensive colour processing technique which meant the magnificent reds, blues and yellows pop out from the screen. The Red Shoes is really stunning to look at, offering a wealth of colours for the audience to luxuriate in. I still hold that Jacque Demy's Umbrellas Of Cherbourg looks better, but in portraying a slightly more fantastical, other worldly environment, The Red Shoes is superlative. The dance choreography is also without peer. Personally, I am not at all a fan of ballet or dance, but this film manages to remain compelling and absorbing. The centrepiece of this is a long, dialogue-less sequence lasting almost 20 minutes, where our eyes feast on a symphony of dance and music. This daring, bravura sequence, far from being tiresome, manages to enchants the audience with the technical mastery of Moria Shearers fantastic performance. Our eyes become glued on her feet, on her graceful, fluid movement as she leaps across the screen. Indeed, the performances in this film, especially Shearers, are sublime. Shearer, a technically accomplished ballet dancer, makes her screen debut in this film, and she is absolutely spellbinding. Her performance has the charm of someone like Grace Kelly mixed with the elegance of Audrey Hepburn. Also, must I say that she is a brilliant dancer? The veteran of film Anton Walbrook also offers a great performance as a cold, emotionless ballet impresario, with a firm belief that one has to choose between their work and their passion. The audience rally feels that Lermotov is almost sociopath material- one can count with one hand the number of scenes where Lermotov shows any real emotion. Marius Goring rounds out the cast as a brilliant young composer vying for Pages affections. Despite the excellence is cinematography, performances, and ballet, reservations still remain for me. The first problem with the film would be that is may be overly artistic and abstract at times, evidenced by the dreamlike, impressionistic aspect of the central 20 minute dance sequence. The bigger problem I have with the film however is with its strange focus and slow pacing. I find the scenes after this central 20 minute sequence to lack the vigour and pace of what preceded it in teh first half. The film glosses over the romance between Page and Craster, instead devoting too much time to the effects of their leaving the company. The film also does not give enough time to explore the dilemma Page faces between her art and her husband. Rather, we focus on Lermotov, something which I do not understand. Overall, I think The Red Shoes will stand as one of the best looking movies of all time. It will also be fondly remembered for its artistry, especially in the central 20 minutes dance sequence, which is spectacular. However, I couldn't enjoy this film as much because of its strange focus in the second half, and I also feel it is slightly too long. Nevertheless, as reviews here has noted, I seem to be in the minority- The Red Shoes is definitely worth a watch.",8 July 2023

Emotions run high, cruelty runs rife and all under the baton of Brian Easdale who has created his own ""Ballet of the Red Shoes"" score. Both Walbrook and Goring were underestimated actors, in my view.

",8,"Perhaps like no other film I've ever seen, I've put off watching The Red Shoes for as long as I can remember. Maybe it's because the film is focused on dancing (something I have barely any interest in), or the inflated running time. It might be a combination of these things. Regardless, even by the time it was over, the movie failed to change my thoughts on an art form I've never thought of as very exciting. Despite the fact that I will probably never find enjoyment in ballet or anything related to it, I can at least appreciate what is often labeled one of the best British movies ever. Like many other films around this time period, a love triangle is what makes the story advance, since without this, the ballet wouldn't have a leg to stand on (no pun intended). The story begins with a ballet performance at a London opera house, organized by Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook). In attendance are a music student named Julian and an aspiring dancer named Victoria Page (Marius Goring and Moira Shearer respectively). After the show, Lermontov and Vicky meet each other and the former asks her to go to a rehearsal with him. Meanwhile, Julian writes an (according to him) silly letter to Boris, in which he explains that his music teacher has ripped off one of his compositions. Julian shows up too late since it turns out Boris has read the letter already. Still, Julian proves to him that he is the one behind the work (Hearts of Fire) by playing it for him on his piano. Boris is so impressed with him that he hires him to coach his ballet dancers, and also to assist Lermontov's main conductor. Later on, Julian and Vicky arrive at the Mercury Theatre, where the latter dances to Swan Lake by Tchaikovsky. After witnessing what a talented ballerina Vicky is for himself, Lermontov takes it upon himself to invite her to France (and later Monaco) with him. While in Monaco, he says how he wants her to be the lifeblood of his new ballet, ""The Ballet of the Red Shoes."" Julian is going to compose for it. As Vicky and Julian work together on Boris' project, they learn to hold each other's talents in high regard. When the time comes for the play to debut, it's a great success, but behind the scenes, Vicky and Julian have fallen for each other. Lermontov eventually finds out about their relationship; something that's supposed to be kept secret. Julian is relieved of his music related duties, and Vicky chooses to leave with him to get married. However, Boris doesn't want to lose such a good source of talent (and revenue), so he seeks out Vicky at a train station. He tells her to put on the red shoes once more, since that's what made her such a hit in the first place. On the night of a new play, Vicky is in her dressing room when Julian and Lermontov appear simultaneously. Each one of them tries to convince her that her only chance at being happy is to go with them. Boris says how she always wanted to be a dancer, so she should focus on that, and Julian tries to remind her of her affection toward him. Vicky, tears in her eyes, comes to the decision that her commitment to being a dancer is more important than Julian and tries to go to the stage. As Julian departs for the train station dejected, Vicky suddenly has a change of heart and goes after him. She jumps over a balcony and lands right in front of an oncoming train and gets struck. Boris gets on the stage and makes the announcement that nobody wants to hear: Miss Page won't be performing tonight (or ever). As a nod to her, they perform the Red Shoes instead of what was originally planned, and Vicky dies holding Julian outside. While I thought this movie was very long for what it is, I do at least admire how they chose to use Technicolor. After all, with a color in the title, there was no reason not to use it. The coloring process was expensive, but for an elaborate movie like this with a lot of scenic locations and ornate buildings, it had to be done. Even though I typically despite musicals, I was able to watch this because it's actually a debatable question whether this qualifies as one. I personally don't consider it as such since the majority of scenes have little to do with music. Even the highlight of the movie, where Vicky performs the actual ballet, is only around 20 minutes. I was disappointed that it wasn't longer. Overall, The Red Shoes is a movie I was kind of let down with, but not because of the film itself. I feel like if I had more of an interest in dance, I would have loved it, but as it is, it just felt like a love story with a ballet theme in my eyes. Add on to this the fact that it's a british production and didn't include any actors I was familiar with, and I felt like I squandered the experience for myself a little bit.

The film's discussion is both important and relevant, however, and Ford demonstrated his understanding of both the mechanisms at play and how the Wayne character was eventually doomed in his encounter with a modern, discussion-based world. Ford's depiction of this is unquestionably the film's strongest point - it's where he shows his versatility and progressive side. And were it not for some very obvious and destructive shortcomings, it could have played out as Ford would have wanted. Unfortunately, the task of lifting the drama up from the fact that James Stewart is too old and torpid as the ""young"" idealistic lawyer is insurmountable. Despite efforts to make him look young, Stewart is nowhere near the unbound, youthful actor he once was in films such as The Philadelphia Story and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. His acting mars almost every dramatic, and hence thematic, segment surrounding his character - which incidentally are the majority of the film's pivotal scenes. John Wayne is also too old, of course, but in his case, it only affects his appearance, not his acting.John Ford is said to have been in a grumpier and more imperious mood than usual on the set of The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. This may well have been because the film's script mirrored the situation he experienced in Hollywood with the transition from the at this point faltering studio system and the glory days of the western genre into the more auteuristic and independent era of filmmaking in the 1960s and 70s. Liberty Valance has an overtone of disillusion and dejection that makes it attractive from a retrospective point of view. In that perspective, it may be fitting that Ford made this flawed film just as the western genre was about to lose its relevance. Dramatically and thematically, it had a potential that could have made it into one of his best films. It has layers and an interpersonal level which few westerns from this or earlier eras could boast. Some of these stand out as remarkably effective, such as the clash between Lee Marvin's interesting villain and a wonderfully unhinged newspaper publisher played by Edmond O'Brien.

rw9531448,ur110212703,tt0048424," Laughton should have directed more
",8,"Charles Laughton's sole work as director is an accomplished, beautifully made, impeccably acted, and perhaps a bit too thin thriller, the announcement of a new talent behind the camera. And the reaction was muted contemporaneously. It was either the negative critical reaction or Laughton's simple preference for directing theater over film, but The Night of the Hunter marked the sole, enticing work behind the camera of Laughton who could have gone on to make several more films, giving us a legacy in film of him beyond his performances in films like Witness for the Prosecution. As it stands, though, if you are going to have only one movie to your name, you could do far, far worse than The Night of the Hunter.The story follows the deranged preacher Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum) who goes from town to town, killing women because he considers the frilly and lacey nature of modern women to be a blight upon God's creation. He's thrown in jail for stealing a car at the same time that Ben Harper (Peter Graves) is thrown in prison with a death sentence for killing two people while stealing $10,000 that he hid with his children, John (Billy Chapin) and Pearl (Sally Jane Bruce), without the knowledge of their mother Willa (Shelley Winters) because she's too trusting. Harry gets a hint of the money's location through Ben's sleep-talking, realizing that the children know. Harry becomes monomaniacal in the pursuit of the money, finding the newly widowed woman, playing up his charm, and marrying her in quick time, all while Pearl falls in love with him and John mistrusts him.The meat of the film is all about danger, this deranged preacher man using his outward position as both a man of God and the new father to these children to commit and threaten violence in pursuit of the universal MacGuffin: a handful of cash. That sense of danger is palpable because of how in control Laughton was in terms of every aspect of the production. Firstly are the performances. The standout showstopper is Mitchum who balances between charming and viciously dangerous with ease. Considering the supposedly true stories of his deep drunkenness the deeper into production he got, that's kind of amazing and a testament to Mitchem as well as Laughton.The supporting cast has their own great moments as well, the early parts dominated by Winters' combination of wounded, expectant, and pious that makes her sympathetic and pathetic all at once, the exact sort of woman who would fall for a slick operator like Powell. That latter half is dominated by the silent film star Lillian Gish who appears as a kindly old woman who takes in wayward children cast out during the Depression, who adds John and Pearl to her brood after the two escape from Powell's murderous ways.Where the film works surprisingly well (only because Laughton was an actor, really) is how gorgeous the film looks from beginning to end. It's rarely realistic, those moments relegated to scenes outside during the day, and there's a heavy use of shadow from the DP Stanley Cortez that takes a full step into German Expressionism, especially the moment that Powell reveals his true nature to Willa, complete with exaggerated arm movements. The action moves outside after Powell becomes too big of a threat, and the river gets filmed on a sound stage primarily at night, creating that artistic look of night where every major figure in the distance is backlit by some major source of light, causing outlines in the dark rather than needing to rely on heavily filtered brightly lit scenes.I suppose one reason I'm held back in appreciation slightly is that good wins. It doesn't feel right for the story, especially after Powell escapes from a lynch mob and disappears from the story completely. There's a happy note at the end, unalloyed by any other emotion, and it doesn't quite seem to fit the rest of the film. The book ends definitively with Powell dying at the hands of the lynch mob, but the movie has him get away, and then we have a happy ending. It just doesn't quite fit. Plus, there doesn't seem to be much of a point by the end except the thrills of the chase we've had, and when we have this happy ending, it seems incongruous with what came before.Still, that's a minor concern. It's a beautifully shot, well-acted, and thrilling ride through the American midwestern countryside. That it was poorly received at the time is not the biggest of surprises. It's all about children in danger and is overwhelmingly meanspirited for much of its runtime, but it's also such a good thrill ride as it goes.I do wish Laughton had directed more. He showed real promise.",31 December 2023

Charles Laughton's only directorial effort is full of offbeat characters, unsettling music, near-surreal cubist imagery, and poetically expressionistic scenes (notably Willa Harper's (an unusually restrained Shelly Winters) final scene in the river). Mitcham is quite good as the creepy black-clad 'hunter', a bit stagy and over-the-top at times, but that is not unexpected for a character playing a character. The actors playing John and Pearl, the Harper young'uns (Billy Chapin and Sally Jane Bruce) are also quite good as are veterans Lillian Gish, the elderly lady who takes the children under her wing and promptly sees through Powell's phoney preacher shtick, and Evelyn Varden, the elderly self-righteous busybody who doesn't. Much of the film was shot on soundstages and Laughton plays with the artificiality of the sets and the lighting to give his film dream-like vibe (the intent to look a bit 'unreal' could explain some of the minors 'errors' noted in the IMDB goofs section). The Night of the Hunter was a unique fusion (for the 1950s) of aesthetics and genres that was a failure with contemporaneous audiences and critics but has since been recognised as a well-crafted piece of 'art-noir'.",4 December 2023

The actors are pretty good across the board; some of them were duds, but Robert Mitchum and Lillian Gish were both at the top of their game. The score itself wasn't anything special, but the use of biblical hymns throughout was well done by Laughton.

",9,"There are many films I still remember as classics even though I last watched them very long ago. Upon rewatching Night of the Hunter, it's easy to say it feels just as thrilling and creepy as it did when I first saw it. While not a horror movie, it makes sense to consider it as one seeing as how the antagonist is so brilliantly portrayed as a genuine psychopath. The story in this takes place in West Virginia during the Depression. Two kids, John and Pearl (Billy Chapin and Sally Jane Bruce respectively) are approached by their criminal father Ben (who has just committed a robbery) and told never to tell anyone where he hid the money he stole. Immediately after, he is cuffed and taken away to be hanged. Before his execution, his cellmate is a preacher named Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum) who tries his hardest to get Ben to give up his secret, but the secret dies with him. Powell was in jail for stealing a car. When he gets out, he goes to Ben's town and catches everyone's attention because he appears to be an honest man of God at first glance, and he also acts the part. Ben's widow, Willa is soon the target of his affection, and she and Powell soon marry. Pearl is naive and doesn't seem to mind, but John's instinct tells him this guy is not to be trusted and he'll never replace his real father. Powell guilt trips Willa into going to religious gatherings with him, believing her only purpose in the eyes of the Lord is to take care of John and Pearl. One night, she comes home late and Powell is caught red handed threatening Pearl about the missing money. Powell realizes Willa is now a liability and must be silenced. He stabs her to death in her bed and sinks an old car into a lake with her corpse in it. Powell comes across John and Pearl and threatens to kill John if he doesn't say where the money is. Pearl finally confesses it's in her doll, which is the truth, but before Powell can do anything, John causes shelves to collapse on his head in the basement. They barely manage to get away by using a small boat to paddle to safety up a river. John and his sister eventually arrive at a house owned by Rachel (Lillian Gish), an affectionate but stern elderly woman who takes care of orphans. Powell manages to find Rachel's house and tries to persuade her that he is the father of John and Pearl, but she isn't fooled and sticks a shotgun in his face. He promises he'll be back. Once night falls, Powell returns and threatens Rachel to give up the kids, so she shoots him. He limps into the barn where he is later apprehended. During his arrest, John is reminded of the pain his father went through while being handcuffed, so he gives up the money to Powell. In court, John can't bring himself to say Powell is guilty, but he will still be executed sometime soon. Back at Rachel's house, John, Pearl and the other children open Christmas gifts. With this legendary movie, Charles Laughton shows that he wasn't just a top of the line actor, but a nearly perfect director too. Sadly, in one of the most baffling anecdotes I can think of off the top of my head, the initial reaction to Night of the Hunter was quite bad. Because of this, Laughton never again directed an actual film. Sometimes, I really do have no faith in humanity. Thank god public opinion has shifted in favor of this film, because there are so many different reasons to praise it. Being a noir, it has a lot of dark shadows and reminds me a lot of Grapes of Wrath. The fact they both take place in the 30s I feel is no coincidence. The music is quite disturbing and really contributes a lot to the moments where Powell is trying to chase after the kids. No matter how slow he moves he always seems to catch up with them. Speaking of whom, Robert Mitchum puts on one of the most defining performances of his whole career here. He's still in a noir, so it's not out of place for him, but even when playing a southerner he does so extremely well. He's one of the most downright evil characters in a noir just because he's perfectly willing to kill children to get what he wants. Silent film legend Lillian Gish also portrays a woman who is determined to stand up for what she thinks is right and does so with much tenacity. It is odd seeing her in a non-silent movie though. The movie is made more convincing by the fact that the main characters are two small children who haven't done anything wrong. It's not their fault their father was a criminal, but because of his choices, they enter a nightmare. In my view, Mitchum's performance makes this movie what it is, but there are tons of other reasons why I consider Night of the Hunter one of my favorite noirs.",17 October 2023

The plot of Farewell My Concubine is innovative and bold, as it is very rare to tell the story of a xizi (opera actor) and prostitute that contains both obvious and vague descriptions to portray the darkness of the story. This film connects multiple different themes and ideas, such as the complexity of humanity, the relationship between art and politics, and gender identity. It presents an unique but powerful perspective of modern Chinese history in an artistic and infectious style, which makes the audiences feel as if they are experiencing the moving tides of history.'I am by nature a girl, not a boy.' For me, this line is one of the most impressive lines in the whole movie. While being trained to play dan, a female role in Peking opera, Xiao Douzi (Cheng Dieyi) always gets the line wrong and gets punished. Is he really unable to memorize such a simple line? The answer is no. As he sings 'I am by nature a boy, not a girl', he is protesting against his destiny. This line portrays Douzi's inner struggle and confusion as well as defiance, who still desires to be recognized as a male. A turning point for Douzi is when he sings the line correctly after Shitou stabbed his mouth with a pipe, which acts as a symbol for authority and power. From this moment, he compromises with his life and stops struggling with his sexual identity. This also foreshadows Douzi's tragic fate, as he becomes so immersed with the role as Yuji that he is unable to tell the difference between the play and reality.Leslie Cheung's performance is really impressive, and it makes me cry several times in the movie.

Cheng Dieyi's deep love for Peking opera and his unbreakable bond with Duan Xiaolou create a moving narrative. Cheng Dieyi's life becomes a testament to the unwavering loyalty depicted in the opera's story of Yu Ji and Xiang Yu.On the other hand, Duan Xiaolou takes a more practical approach, lacking Cheng Dieyi's passion for Peking opera. Driven by a desire for a peaceful life, he marries Juxian to escape the Japanese and later betrays Cheng Dieyi to join the Nationalist Party. Adapting to modern times, he shifts to singing modern plays, making choices that betray not only others but also his own values. Despite loving Cheng Dieyi, he struggles to understand Cheng Dieyi's profound dedication, leading to the loss of relationships and his own identity.The film uses visuals and sounds to evoke emotions. Black-and-white tones signify tragic conclusions and reflections, while the colored middle section showcases vibrant costumes and the characters' lives across different eras.From a Chinese audience perspective:1. The characters represent the resilience of the Chinese people against foreign pressures, reflecting the struggles for national identity.2. The film celebrates traditional Chinese culture, emphasizing the significance of Peking opera as a rich art form rooted in history and culture.3.

Why didn't the corrupt democracy of Chiang Kai Shek and Sun Yat Sen survive? Corrupt democracies in other countries survive (look at the US), so why not China? The problems in China go way back to the 19th century, when England created the Golden Triangle (financing opium farms in India and selling the opium to China). This created great wealth and power for the UK, but left millions of Chinese addicted and broken. This led to several revolts in China, such as the Taiping and Boxer rebellions against the Qing, the ruling royals of the country. Both rebellions were unsuccessful in ridding China of Western domination, but they did cause the fall of the Qing in 1911. The Qing was replaced by a ""democracy"" headed by Sun Yat Sen and Chiang Kai Shek.Unfortunately, the corruption and devastation caused by the UK could not be overcome by the KMT (the name of political party Sun Yat Sen headed). So, when people are faced with desperate situations, they resort to desperate measures; enter the CCP (Chinese Communist Party). Initially, Mao Zedong and the CCP were good for China; they gave women equal rights, stabilized food prices, and brought millions out of poverty.However, Mao fell into disfavor immediately after the tortuous 10 years of the Cultural Revolution, where millions starved to death, and economic opportunity ceased to exist. His mistakes were reversed by his successor, Deng Xiaoping, who opened up China to economic development (One Party, Two Systems). This film tries to cover all of these events in only three hours, and partially succeeds in doing so. The personal interaction of the two friends and Gong Li is actually secondary to the events surrounding the three of them. This film was an enormous undertaking by a master of Chinese cinema, director Chen Kaige, one of the two greatest Chinese directors of all time (the other being Zhang Yimou).Kaige would go on to make another great Chinese film, Devil at the Doorstep, a story about the occupation of China by the Japanese. But this film still stands as his greatest work as far as international recognition is concerned. Winning Cannes is not easy, and trying to introduce Westerners into understanding modern China is even more difficult. Kaige was at least partially successful in doing just that.

However, I fear that I was not fully prepared for what awaited me.In fact, the film is truly brutal, in every sense of the word. Director Kaige Chen took a well-known and respected book for his film, but put all the focus on an almost visceral realism. The film is an epic that spans a large period of time, between 1924 and 1977, that is, very troubled years in Chinese history, which includes the entire period of war against Japan and the invasion of Manchuria, as well as the cultural revolution. Maoist.At the same time, it reveals the backstage of Cantonese opera, a traditional Chinese cultural style. In the film, two young apprentices live a cruel and unhappy life at the opera school, with daily beatings and various abuses, including sexual abuse. One of them will play the female characters in the stories, like a transvestite, since women are not allowed on stage. Throughout the film, there is a lot of confusion between life and art, and we often feel that these actors are mixing things up, living their characters in real life and transposing their real life to the stage.I don't know any of the actors in the cast, but I really liked their overall work, and the way they play opposite each other. The film also has extraordinary scenarios, full of realistic details, such as the construction of buildings, the lanterns. The actors' costumes also deserve applause, especially the characters in the opera, with all those fabrics and those strong face paints. Finally, a word for the wonderful cinematography, excellent opening credits and soundtrack.",12 November 2022

",8,"One crime and two totally different men: this sentence almost sums up the entire film. Director Orson Welles is one of those monsters that we are used to having like a ""sacred cow"", who turns everything he touches into gold. And really, he is responsible for great films and was an excellent artist, who understood cinema like few others did. However, in this film, his work was absolutely trampled on by stupid studio managers, and the result of this is that it was only very recently that it was possible to have access to a version of this film that was similar to what its director's creative vision was. . Just similar!And what we have here is an incredibly complex film that we cannot summarize as easily as I did: the initial crime is just the incident that triggers the action, and its relevance, we found, is really insignificant. What counts here is the struggle of personalities, the battle between the conflicting egos of two police officers who decide to solve the case, each in their own way. In fact, it is not the most appealing film that the director's career has given us, but it is still valuable for that reason. And to understand Welles' vision, it's not enough to see the film once. We have to understand nuances that go unnoticed by an inattentive eye. It's an exercise for cinema experts, more than for me, who am part of the common popcorn-eating public, but even I saw that the work before me deserved to be seen in detail.The film that has come down to us allows us to see the brilliance of Welles, who was also responsible for the dialogues and the script created, full of twists and turns that can complicate things a little for us if we are not paying attention, and, but it also gives us good actors in a decent dramatic exercise. Charlton Heston is a safe bet, but it's also a big casting mistake: he's too Anglo-Saxon to be credible as a Latino! Welles brought the other main character to life, and is effective and dominant in the role. To a certain extent, he never seems like a police officer, but just another criminal in a land where those in charge are those who impose themselves through violence. Even so, I noticed that he is a physically worn-out man, and this fragility ruins the effect he intends to achieve.Technically, the film has many qualities, starting with the cinematography, which in Welles' films is almost always one of the director's signatures. In addition to the use of intelligent visual effects, the director dedicated himself to the camera work and the choice of each perspective, each framing, and also in the editing, which was ruined by the studio's intervention. The filming locations and sets are realistic and convince us quite well, and the soundtrack is effective.",5 September 2023

",10,"Orson Welles' ""Touch of Evil"" is a quintessential film noir, an audacious fusion of style and substance that underscores the director's mastery over the medium. Released in 1958, it's a compelling exploration of the blurry lines between good and evil, carried by an all-star cast and an abundance of stylistic flair.The plot revolves around a border-town murder mystery, with Charlton Heston portraying the honest Mexican narcotics officer, Mike Vargas, and Welles himself as the corrupt American police captain, Hank Quinlan. The stark contrast between these two characters lays the foundation for a captivating narrative that traverses a morally ambiguous landscape.Heston and Welles deliver powerful performances, each embodying their character's attributes with convincing authenticity. Janet Leigh, as Vargas' newlywed wife, is also noteworthy, adding a touch of vulnerability to the plot's tension-charged atmosphere.Welles' directorial genius shines throughout the film, exemplified in the famous opening shot: a single, unbroken three-minute take that is as suspenseful as it is technically impressive. His innovative use of camera angles, shadow, and sound creates an atmospheric setting that truly brings the narrative to life.""Touch of Evil"" boasts striking cinematography, marked by deep shadows, skewed angles, and stark contrasts that capture the essence of film noir. The eclectic score, ranging from lively mariachi music to hauntingly eerie compositions, complements the visual storytelling effectively.However, the real triumph of ""Touch of Evil"" lies in its ability to provoke thought. It doesn't merely serve as a gripping mystery; it offers a profound exploration of the human condition, illustrating how the road to hell can often be paved with good intentions.That said, the film is not without its share of potential drawbacks. Some viewers might find its complex narrative structure and moral ambiguity challenging to follow. Additionally, the decision to cast Heston as a Mexican officer, while a testament to his acting prowess, may seem questionable from today's perspective.Yet, despite these potential criticisms, ""Touch of Evil"" remains an undeniable masterpiece in the realm of film noir. Its ability to blend a riveting plot with masterful cinematography, exceptional performances, and thought-provoking themes leaves a lasting impression.In conclusion, ""Touch of Evil"" is a tour de force of cinematic artistry that transcends its genre. It is a movie that makes you think, feel, and appreciate the depth of human complexity, all while immersing you in a world of suspense and intrigue. Whether you're a fan of film noir or simply a lover of fine cinema, ""Touch of Evil"" is a must-watch that continues to resonate with audiences to this day.",21 May 2023

",10,"When Universal hired Orson Welles to appear in TOUCH OF EVIL, he had long been considered a Hollywood outcast due to his rebellious nature and disdain for the front office. In addition to acting, he also ended up being hired to write and direct TOUCH OF EVIL thanks to the insistence of star Charlton Heston, who was recently basking in the success of THE TEN COMMANDMENTS and therefore had enough clout to chose whoever he wanted for a director. Ever since appearing in THE THIRD MAN, Welles remained in Europe to continue his filmmaking away from Tinseltown's radar, fed up with executives re-editing his finished product against his wishes.Contrary to legend, it wasn't TOUCH OF EVIL that brought Welles back to America. He'd already returned to New York in the mid Fifties to act on television and radio before getting the call from Universal. Welles wanted Janet Leigh to play Heston's wife and sent her a telegram thanking her for accepting.....before her agent had a chance to contact her!!! Welles also pulled off some casting coups that Universal execs didn't see coming. He convinced old friend Marlene Dietrich to appear as a Gypsy madam under near-heavy disguise and, during an advanced screening, the higher-ups were flabbergasted to see Frau Dietrich up there. They had no idea she was in the cast. Welles also persuaded former members of his old Mercury Theatre ~and CITIZEN KANE co-stars~ Joseph Cotten and Ray Collins to join. (Cotten's was an uncredited cameo.)However, Welles must have been overcome with a sense of déjà vu during postproduction because, once again, he butted heads with the front office. Unhappy with his final cut, Universal proceeded to edit TOUCH OF EVIL against his wishes. Upon learning what was afoot, an impassioned Welles wrote a memo containing almost sixty pages of suggested revisions, all of which fell on deaf ears. When the film was finally released, it was written off as a B-movie with an A-list pedigree.More than forty years later, Universal had the opportunity to right that wrong when Welles' memo was unearthed, containing all his suggestions for improvement. Using that memo as a guideline, famed editor Walter Murch was brought in to revise TOUCH OF EVIL according to Welles' wishes. The result was a masterpiece restored.The first five minutes of TOUCH OF EVIL is a glorious, unbroken tracking shot beginning on the Mexican side of the border town Los Robles, in which a mysterious figure plants a time bomb in the trunk of a car. Getting into the car is a prominent American citizen accompanied by some lady of the evening, where they drive up the street to the customs station. Walking alongside them is Miguel ""Mike"" Vargas (played by the Caucasian Heston in a bit of casting that would raise eyebrows today), a vacationing Mexican narc enjoying his a honeymoon with American wife Susie (Leigh).The famous tracking shot ends with a deafening explosion as the car detonates, killing both occupants. Heading the investigation is Chief Hank Quinlan (Welles), a grotesquely obese man whose mumbling makes Marlon Brando enunciate like Laurence Olivier. Quinlan is renowned among the community and beyond for his intuitive spot-on hunches, to which he attributes a gimpy leg from an old bullet injury. (In DOUBLE INDEMNITY, Edward G Robinson's sixth sense was brought on by indigestion).A recovering alcoholic, Quinlan is admired by superiors and underlings alike for never having taken a dishonest dollar in his life. His poultry ranch seems to be the only thing keeping him from a vow of poverty. With attributes such as these, it would be tempting to vote Quinlan as lawman of the year..... except that he's an unapologetic racist! He's lived in a border town for probably most of his life, and has performed his duty on both sides, but has never bothered to learn or speak Spanish. He treats white suspects and witnesses with the appropriate decorum, but less so with their non-white counterparts.Vargas himself has a stellar professional reputation on both sides as an oficial de narcóticos. Recently, he gained fame and respect for his arrest of a big time Mexican gangster named Vince Grandi, whose brother Joe fancies himself the unofficial godfather of Los Robles. Being a younger and Hispanic detective, plus being married to a white woman, Vargas unwittingly taps into the darkest recesses of Quinlan's psyche, since it's obvious the lawman is not the staunchest advocate for miscegenation.However, it's the policing methods that really set the two men apart from one another. Vargas is a by-the-book cop who believes in due process, while Quinlan is not above using some....uh, primitive persuasion to obtain a confession. These differences will come to a head when Quinlan arrests the Mexican boyfriend of the dead man's daughter following the alleged discovery of two incriminating sticks of dynamite in the suspect's bathroom. Vargas doesn't see it so open and shut because he was just washing his hands in the bathroom prior to the search and never saw the evidence where Quinlan claimed it was! Vargas openly accuses him of framing the Hispanic, and vows to formally raise the matter with the proper authorities.The stage is now set for the inevitable collision course as Quinlan, desperate to clear his name and slander Mike Vargas, forms an unholy alliance with Joe Grandi, who has his own reasons for wanting to discredit Vargas. Because the narco cannot be intimidated, Grandi believes that the best way to control Vargas is by involving Susie into their deadly cat and mouse game.I've seen lots of black & white films noir that visually convey the danger element for every drop that can be squeezed. THE MALTESE FALCON, DOUBLE INDEMNITY, THE KILLERS, and THE BIG SLEEP, all moody crime tales set within the asphalt jungle, are among the greatest of the genre. TOUCH OF EVIL, taking place taking place in arid and rural surroundings, tops them all pictorially with its vivid illustrations of sheer decadence. Off the top of my head, an example of overwhelming atmosphere is a foreground of newspapers blowing across a windy street complemented by a background of endlessly pumping oil derricks. Oh, and Henry Mancini's offbeat Latino rock score contribute enormously to the sinful climate.Welles' camera is more than just a camera; it's a window into the seedy soul of human nature: the brothels, the nearly topless bars, and hints of reefer madness. Welles pushed that envelope as far as he could in 1958. Like IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT a decade later, the murder investigation almost takes a back seat to the personality conflicts of its two leads who are different morally as they are racially.Heston's later-in-life right-wing politics didn't produce an admirer in me, but complaints about his being cast as a Hispanic, pre-civil rights, should be answered with a resounding shout down. Yes, a Caucasian taking on a role like that would be politically incorrect today, but TOUCH OF EVIL was made in a far different era, a time before Martin Luther King and Cesar Chavez became household names. Besides, any rational mind could see this casting wasn't anywhere on the same level as D. W. Griffith's notoriously racist BIRTH OF A NATION.In Welles' lifetime even his enemies had to grudgingly admit he was a genius. Posthumously, as his films are routinely analyzed and re-analyzed, he's now regarded as one of the greatest and most misunderstood artists of the 20th century. For film noir lovers, their libraries will never be complete without TOUCH OF EVIL. 🔚",21 April 2023

Whilst they are out doing their sleuthing, ""Susan Vargas"" (Janet Leigh) is lured to a meeting with ""Uncle Joe"" (Akim Tamiroff) where it becomes clear that her husband is on the prosecuting side of a family dispute that is putting everyone in danger - something her husband finds out shortly afterwards when he narrowly avoids an acid facial. Now ""Quinlan"" and his sidekick ""Menzies"" (Joseph Calleia) have a rather unique way of working - the former intimidates just with his presence and has the District Attorney in his pocket, but as this investigation starts to spread out the original crime pails into insignificance as ""Susan"" finds herself trapped in an out of town motel and the potential victim of a ghastly drug crime that brings the threads of the story - and the true criminality to light - fatally.

I was slightly dubious about Heston playing a Mexican policeman, but here carries of the role in one of his better screen performances (when he is not wearing leather garments) and Janet Leigh - well, she was always an actor who made it all look effortless.

rw8951093,ur1964495,tt0052311," Exquisite, masterful, absolutely essential
",10,"Film noir is already a genre that is defined in large part by artistic flourishes in its craftsmanship to reshape and lend flavor to the crime thriller and drama. I don't think it's unfair to say that Orson Welles' vision for this feature takes that tendency to another level. From the very opening shot those minutiae that audiences often take for granted all build tension and suspense, and contribute strongly to the storytelling, as much as Welles' own adapted screenplay. Walter Murch's painstaking, somewhat unorthodox editing (in the 1998 restoration, accordingly following Welles' notes) is a wondrous gift; Russell Metty's truly exquisite, sharp, dynamic cinematography quite makes this worth watching all by itself; the precise use of light and shadow has rarely felt more alive in a film; Welles' meticulous fundamental orchestration of shots and scenes is some of the most gratifyingly robust direction to readily come to mind. From the very start, in even the most basic of ways, 'Touch of evil' is an extraordinary, captivating picture that demands viewer engagement as much for the intricacy of its construction and plot, and the excellence thereof, as for the swiftness of the pacing. For those very same reasons this is marginally challenging, but all the more terrific for the fact of it. This has a very high reputation, and it's fully deserved; frankly, this is surely one of the greatest of all film noir titles, if not altogether one of the best movies ever made.There are times when the marvel of the work behind the scenes, including production design and filming locations, threatens to overshadow other elements to some degree. And that's saying a lot, because the acting is strikingly potent. From one scene to the next a different actor may stand out most, but across the board everyone gives a smart, rather intense performance that holds fast our attention. Given the most time on-screen naturally Janet Leigh, Charlton Heston, and Welles stand out most, with stark poise and force of personality, and particularly noteworthy nuance and range in Leigh's case. Yet even those in smaller supporting parts all distinctly stand out in their own ways, lending tremendously to the raw tenor of the tableau, including Joseph Calleia, Ray Collins, Marlene Dietrich, Dennis Weaver, and more. And yet, for as great as the acting is, and for as exceptional as the craftsmanship is, still the writing is possibly more darkly vibrant and ferocious. Noir commonly goes to grim forbidding places with a harsh miasma of foul figures, dirty deeds, and bad business, spiraling ever outwards and downwards. It hardly seems plausible, but 'Touch of evil' becomes more terrible yet - if not outright bleak - in a tale of utmost corruption, abuse of power, and lack of accountability. Every facet of the screenplay bristles with biting electricity that keeps us firmly locked in through every seedy turn, to the point that for as much as Welles earned his esteem as both an actor and a director, his shrewd wit as a writer may actually have been greater yet.Furthermore, it seems impossible to talk about this picture without also mentioning the original music of Henry Mancini. Every theme to greet our ears resounds with vivid clarity that feeds stupendously into the gnawing, clamorous airs otherwise achieved. A score is always important to any movie, even when it sticks to the background, but some immediately pop out more than others. Though no singular instance may stick out from Mancini's work here, let there be no doubt that Welles' masterpiece surely couldn't be the incredible tour de force that it is without these compositions. And that's kind of the real takeaway here: nothing in 'Touch of evil' is superfluous, and there is no part without which it could be complete, because this is a perfect creation. It's immensely absorbing, entertaining, and satisfying as a viewer despite and because of its gloomy narrative, its riveting acting, its rich music, and the fastidious, careful, fabulously attentive contributions of every last person operating behind the scenes. I could easily imagine the feature being broken down frame by frame for analysis of its composition, and to do so would be a worthy pursuit for the supreme mindfulness with which the production was approached. By all means, I assumed I would enjoy this based on what I knew of it ahead of time, and still I'm totally blown away; it cannot be overstated how utterly superb this title is. Given the dour subject matter and story I can maybe understand how it won't readily appeal to all comers, but some movies supersede questions of personal preference. In all honesty 'Touch of evil' is something that everyone owes it to themselves to watch at least once, and I can't offer any recommendation higher than that.",26 March 2023

",6,"Touch Of Evil (1958) -This was the best performance I have ever seen from Orson Welles. Up until this point I had been very disappointed with 'Citizen Kane' (1941), 'The Lady From Shanghai' (1947), 'The Magnificent Ambersons' (1942) and 'The Third Man' (1949) and as such I could not for the life of me understand why he was so well regarded by the film industry and critics. For instance, all of those films mentioned were featured on Stephen Schneider's Top 1001 films list.Perhaps if the reverence for Mr. Welles was based on just this film and others that he might have done with a similarly fantastic performance I would understand, because Orson WAS very good in this one and really he lead the whole film for me. These are all things that I never thought that I would hear myself saying about the man, having not just disliked his other roles and films, but found them to be awful. Needless to say that I was a little bit surprised, but happily so.However, another actor that I have never been fond of, Charlton Heston, didn't improve my opinions of his abilities with his performance in this film, because he was as wooden as ever and didn't come across as Mexican in any way at all. It might have been better if he had at least had an accent, because it was harder to believe the dispute between them based on his ethnic background and thus the whole racial issue was much less clear due to it.I did think that Marlene Dietrich in her role of Tanya needed a bigger part though. I liked her character and thought that there was more to discover about her, almost as if she might be the focus of the next episode, if it had been a TV series and they were trying to spread out some of the mystery.And I did have to feel for poor Janet Leigh who never seems to have had a good time of it at roadside motels.The filming style was as if the Director didn't want to have the same shot for more than a few seconds at a time and was somewhat like a game of tennis to watch, backwards and forwards all the time from face to face, car to building, Etc. I got whiplash at some points.And there were some other odd touches that didn't seem to be necessary to the plot, but I supposed added colour.Their was a weird bit with a wig and then a blind woman in a shop and also a very small lift. I wasn't sure why they put them in. Maybe they were just trying to distract the audience from the rest of the mystery with extraneous information, but it just stuck out to me.I did feel that because the film appeared to be quite rushed that there were bits that weren't given their full time to sink in for the viewer, so there were points where I wasn't sure if I'd missed something, as other things progressed. As soon as one thing was revealed, another thing was uncovered and I was still thinking about the first thing, if you catch my drift.It was also quite brutal for it's time, the violence seemed more than the usual for a 1958 film and it was added to by the music, which was a bit loud and overwhelming. I supposed that was the point, because it made me anxious, corrupt police films always rile me up anyway. Where are the 'Serpico's' (1973) when you need them? Charlie tried to deliver something similar, but just couldn't pull it off.I was hugely impressed by this one, which was far from how I had imagined that it would turn out. I would go so far as to say that I enjoyed it. The mystery and intrigue was engaging, although I did think that a modern version could bring much more to it, without the cuts and restrictions of the studio executives and censorship of the 1950's.

The strength throughout may be greater at some points more than others, but one way or another there's not much arguing that 'The Gold Rush' is a treasure of a silent film that should be and is rightly revered.Splendid effects and stunts liven up those lovely sets, with excellent costume design, hair, and makeup on top. As Chaplin writes, directs, produces, and edits in addition to starring, he effectively had total control over the final product - and given all his experience in the young film industry by 1925, and as an entertainer, there's no disputing what a keen sense he had for giving audiences a good time. By one measure or another this may not immediately impress as much as some of the man's other works, but that's mostly just a matter of personal preference. Even for those viewers who have a harder time engaging with older pictures, the quality here is so steady that I've a hard time imagining anyone couldn't find something to enjoy.Chaplin is just about as reliable as actors come, highly capable in his range and nuance while also gladly willing to sacrifice his body for a fine gag.

In fact, maybe it was a reflection of their friendship in real life, but even though Hale has less time on-screen than even Swain, it says so much about the warmth she provides for the feature, not to mention Chaplin's intelligence as a filmmaker, that the single best scene in the length may well be the ending that they share. As if the value of the movie was ever in doubt, the last moments solidify it.What more is there to say? More than forty years after he died, and over a century after he first began making his name in cinema, the man remains a household name. Techniques and technology may have progressed, but good comedy never grows old, and the credits of Charlie Chaplin will continue to endure and inspire laughs long after audiences have completely forgotten whatever was released in even just the past year or so. However one may rank this title standing next to its brethren, 'The Gold Rush' holds up as a terrific joy that's well worth revisiting.",18 August 2023

rw9087135,ur1279842,tt0015864," The Three Faces of The Gold Rush's Leading Lady!
",10,"As most of Charlie Chaplin's fans now know, he authorized the release of two versions of The Gold Rush (TGR): the original silent one running 82 minutes-----and a 1942 revised and considerably re-edited one minus title cards, with added music and Chaplin's own narration running 72 minutes. Most critics believe the revised version to be inferior to its silent predecessor.What some of those fans may not know is that there were three different actresses involved in playing the dance-hall lovely who charmed The Little Prospector in Chaplin's classic tale. The first, Edna Purviance (born in 1895), was Chaplin's initial leading lady in many of his earlier films and was the one he first considered to play the part. However, when Chaplin finally began to seriously work on the project, Purviance was approaching the age of 30 and he ultimately considered her to be too old for the role.Next up was a young lady named Lita Grey (born in 1908). Chaplin first met Grey when she was just six years old and he was age 25. They became re-acquainted when she reached the age of 12, and he then cast her to play an adult-like part as the ""flirty angel"" in The Kid (1921). Apparently Grey's emerging adolescence stimulated Chaplin to see her as a young woman. In any event, when Purviance dropped out of the picture, Chaplin projected Grey------then only an early teenager-----to be someone capable of playing the leading part of the dance-hall girl who captures his heart. The TGR company moved from Hollywood to its remote winter location site of Truckee, CA and began shooting exteriors and a few scenes with Grey. Then Life began to imitate Art. Chaplin soon developed a romantic relationship with the 15 year old girl, which resulted in her becoming pregnant. Obviously Grey could not continue with her part in TGR. Chaplin and Grey entered into a hasty wedding (his second and her first) in Mexico, and her filmed scenes in TGR were scrapped. Shortly thereafter, Grey had her first child with Chaplin (Charles Chaplin, Jr.) soon followed by a second son (Sydney Earl Chaplin). The marriage was unsuccessful and three years later, it was followed by an acrimonious divorce. Many years of domestic conflict were to continue for Chaplin and Grey.Who was now to play the leading lady part in TGR? Chaplin was impressed by the performance of Georgia Hale (born in 1906) in Josef Von Sternberg's first Hollywood film, The Salvation Hunters (1925), and she was quickly lined up for the role. Perhaps somewhat less appealing than Grey but just as charming, Hale and Chaplin hit it off and worked successfully during the filming of TGR. In fact, they, too, began a romantic alliance during the shoot-----but it was not complicated by an unwanted pregnancy. Hale and Chaplin continued their personal involvement with each other on and off for several years thereafter. She never appeared in another film with Chaplin.The miracle of TGR is that none of the off-screen drama that plagued Chaplin at this time emerges in the finished film. His genius managed to bring all of its different elements together undiminished by the intimate turmoil and distractions thar swirled around the production. It seems as fresh and enjoyable today as it did when released almost 100 years ago. TGR is one of the greatest films ever made and possibly Chaplin's finest creation. It is an enduring tribute to Chaplin's extraordinary creativity that he was able to overcome his personal adversity and give us a film for the ages.",29 May 2023

It isn't bad since Chaplin himself redid it, but I just prefer the original.It isn't as funny as The Kid, not as heartbreaking as City Lights, and it doesn't have the social commentary of Modern Times. Instead it has a little bit of everything plus lots of atmosphere AND it takes Chaplin's Little Tramp out of some anonymous urban environment and lands him in a very specific place and time - the Klondike gold rush of the late 1890s. I could feel the biting cold, the hunger, the loneliness. And in spite of this being set in the 1890s and seeming quite authentic to its setting, this film has a very modern feel to it, almost timeless.Chaplin's ""little fellow"" is introduced as a lone prospector. We never see him doing any prospecting, but it is later mentioned that he is not very successful at it and gives it up. The first part of the film has the little fellow waiting out a blizzard in a cabin with a wanted criminal in addition to a fellow prospector. The second part has Chaplin's character traveling to a Klondike boom town, watching a cabin for a more successful prospector, and falling in love with a dance hall girl who thinks his crush is just a big joke, at least at first.I don't think it was Chaplin's best silent film, but it does manage to do all aspects of the production very well and I can see why some people would judge it as his best. And if that was Chaplin in that chicken suit, all I can say is that he had the motions of a chicken down pat. To know what I'm talking about, watch and find out.",24 May 2023

It's obvious that Ullman doesn't want her family to feel the neglect she did, so she's taken in her incapacitated sister and never stopped mourning a son who died at the age of four. Mother and daughter reunion is greatly anticipated yet bittersweet in this classic Ingmar Bergman film that further confused movie viewers who mistakenly thought that Ingrid and Ingmar were related.It's a difficult assignment for both Ingrid and Liv who play completely different types of women, related but unable to relate. On the surface, Ingrid is gregarious and grand, but it's obvious that she didn't have what it took to be a successful mother, while Ullman is subservient seemingly by choice to everyone even though she's had her own attempts at a music and writing career. She has her best moment as she looks on at her mother playing a piece of music just for her, so many thoughts going through her head that no dialog could capture all her torment.A personal drama that only a master like Ingmar Bergman could comprehend to write down, giving small individual scenes of quiet strength to Halvar Björk as Ullman's pensive husband and Lena Nyman as her sister, dropped off in a hospital and basically forgotten by her mother until Ullman took her in. This is drenching to watch emotionally because it seems that there can't be a proper conclusion for such different people to understand and forgive, but as drama, it's like Chekhov or Ibsen done in a modern setting. Bergman deserved the high praise she got, but Ullman has an equally hard job, and brings her own A game, so it's a masterpiece for both great Swedish ladies of the stage and screen.",19 August 2023

Mitchum personifies a conflicted noir lead (as he does effortlessly in his other noir work.)

At the same time she must also sidestep Kirk Douglas, her criminal boss. He is terrific despite this being one of his first meaningful roles.

Mostly drawn by its short runtime, I learned about Bergman's rich catalogue of movies. His movies are definitely nothing like I've ever seen. There are many close-ups and the movie felt more like a play than a movie. That being said, it is written very well and ""Autumn Sonata"" feels like it really has the female gaze because I feel that it's portrayed mother-daughter relationship quite well. We have two fabulous actresses taking on that monumental task, Liv Ullmann (who appears in many of Bergman's films) and Ingrid Bergman, portraying daughter and mother, respectively. Both actresses poured their heart out into this movie and I could see it. The close-up shots really helped to see the little details of the subtle facial expressions as well. I also enjoyed the ending where the Charlotte doesn't reflect on her past and goes about living the same way she did and Eva apologizes for her actions, which is in character for her. In the end, Charlotte's a narcissist who doesn't know how to care about others at all beyond her own ambition and desires. A tragic ending at its finest.However, it's difficult for me to give a score higher than 4 because I feel like it's maxing out on the written part of the movie.

What is more personal than the roiling, complicated feelings among family? From the relatively low-key first two-thirds, in which Eva and Charlotte poorly pretend at everything being okay, to the ferocious last act in which every deep-seated enmity and self-hatred comes gushing out, to the somewhat ambiguous ending that may portend a flicker of hope or a continuation of the status quo, 'Autumn sonata' surges like a storm that leaves uncertainty in its wake.The picture boasts terrible depths that relatively few others have been able to achieve, or at least certainly without the same level of vibrant success. With searingly realist flair the screenplay broaches the true difficulty of communication where any feelings are involved: expectations learned directly or indirectly from other family members; self-loathing instilled with the most casual of remarks or gestures; neglect, the absence of love, the inability to love; resentment bred from what goes unspoken, and from the concatenation of circumstances; incapability of communicating openly without completely tearing down the facade that has been kluged together over time; intoxicants as the only key to unlocking any earnestness. And so on, and so on. Anyone who has not had at least some small degree of these experiences with their own family members is either lying to themselves or extraordinarily fortunate; anyone who doesn't recognize the ugly, frank genuineness in Bergman's screenplay should be either pitied or congratulated - I'm not sure which.Between Bergman's skill as both writer and director, and stalwart cinematographer Sven Nykvist's keen eye, every shot and scene feels both perfectly natural and absolutely meticulous in its construction. The story is simple on the surface, but only because its core is one strictly of acerbic dialogue and profound emotion; its characters are as real and human as any flesh and blood. In the peerless hands of Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullmann, those characters burst to life with all the incredible range, nuance, and personality they or anyone could possibly muster. Long before the tumultuous peak rolls around, there's a moment where Charlotte, played by Bergman, is quietly observing Eva (Ullmann), and such a flurry of disparate thoughts and feelings crosses her face within a matter of a few seconds, realized with total control and coolness, that it strikes me as some of the most remarkable acting I've ever seen. As the conversations between mother and daughter escalate their performances only reach an ever-greater crescendo, not least with Ullmann flawlessly capturing Eva's exquisitely awful swirl of hurt and hate - to the point that though this zenith is hardly more than dialogue, it becomes as wholly riveting as any feature could hope to be.None of this is to count out more the more subtle but equally solid supporting performances of Lena Nyman, Halvar Björk, or others, nor the swell contributions of other folks involved. Yet the real power of 'Autumn sonata' unquestionably lies within its two principle stars, and Bergman's painfully honest writing, and this is all the movie needs to be a tremendous success. I had mixed expectations before watching based simply on my reactions to Ingmar to date, but there's no doubt in my mind that this is surely among his best films; in the very least, it's among his most personal and impactful. A content warning of a sort may be appropriate for those who have had troubled relationships with their own family, yet at that, there's a certain measure of catharsis in seeing such ills played out before us. Even just as a matter of cinematic preferences this won't appeal to all viewers, but for those who appreciate a good drama, whatever turns it might take, this is pretty much a must-see, well worth seeking out.",19 February 2023

The emotions and the tension, as one reveals to the other the torment and torture endured through childhood and beyond as believable as any captured through film.

",8,"In the early 19th century, Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson), his explorer High Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), and the rest of the fur trapping expedition are attacked by a group of Indians. The few members of the group who manage to survive flee with the skins on a boat. Abandoned by the crew, Glass attempts to cross the desolate wasteland with only one idea in mind: revenge; and especially against a damned enemy, John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy). They left him for dead, he wouldn't forget it !. They just couldn't find the time to bury him. They should have done it. The savagery of nature against the will of a man. He is dead, they thought. He is dead, they hoped. The man who was left for dead. Join his wild fight. He could make it out alive. Left alone to die. . . His only thought was to stay alive. One who has returned, as from the dead. Lost blood. Found life.Relentless revenge and a crude fight for survival are the main pillars of this interesting film. Loosely based on the book of the same name by Michael Punke, it narrates the difficult days on the brink of death of a real person, Hugh Glass, a trapper and explorer from the early 19th century about whom there is very little verified data, thus there is no record of whether or not this prominent historic figure had a wife and children. DiCaprio's character is based on real mountain man Hugh Glass, and one of the two men left to await Glass's death was a very young Jim Bridger. This story was also previously adapted into another good film: ¨The Man in the wilderness (1971)¨ by Richard T. Heffron with Richard Harris. Due to the success of The Revenant (2015), which sparked growing interest in this film, Warner Brothers released The Man in the Wilderness on Blu-ray on August 16, 2016, as part of its Warner Archive Collection. And the central theme 'one man's fight against the natural environment across a dangerous snowy landscape' was also dealt with in other films, such as: 'Jeremiah Johnson (by Sidney Pollack)', 'The Man Called Horse (by Eliott Silverstein and also starring Richard Harris)¨ and ¨The Return of a Man Called Horse (by Irwin Keshner)¨. In Revenant 2015 there are many strong scenes and lots of cold-blooded deaths, and despite some bloody images and various acts of violence, the film is rated PG-16. Stunning performance stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a brave fur trapper, left for dead after a bear attack, who recovers and pursues his former companions through risky Indian territory. His portrayal of Hugh Glass earned him numerous awards, in addition to the Oscar and the Golden Globe. He personally performed the stunts, doing his perilous own stunts, without stand-in. Another great protagonist is Tom Hardy, nominated for an Oscar for his role as the evil John Fitzgerald, giving an adequate performance as the hateful Fitzgerald. DiCaprio and Hardy are well accompanied by excellent supporting actors, including the following: Domhnall Gleeson, Will Poulter, Forrest Goodluck, Paul Anderson and Kristoffer Joner.This The Revenant (2015) was the winner of three Oscars (director, lead actor and photography) and three Golden Globes (dramatic film, director in a dramatic film and actor) in addition to many other prizes. Also noteworthy is the excellent soundtrack by Ryuichi Sakamoto and Alva Noto, as well as the spectacular and multi-award-winning photography by Mexican Emmanuel Lubezki. Well directed and co-written (along with Mark L. Smith) by Alejandro G. Iñarritu (Amores Perros, Babel, 21 Grams, Biutiful, Birdman), who offers an impressive and colorful story. Rating: 7.5/10.

",3,"Here we have yet another film that nosedived at the box office upon release, only to be mystifyingly resurrected years later as an entry in The National Film Registry. In my view, the audiences of 1957 got it right the first time around-this screenplay is a festering concoction of cinematic misery.Purporting to illuminate the unholy alliance between gossip columnists and publicists within the entertainment industry, ""The Sweet Smell of Success"" attempts to navigate the treacherous waters of smear campaigns employed to torpedo the careers of performers. The legendary left-wing playwright Clifford Odets was called upon to adapt a novelette, purportedly a hatchet job on gossip guru Walter Winchell from the 1930s and 1940s, who later transformed into an anti-Communist commentator during the 1950s.Front and center is Burt Lancaster's portrayal of J. J. Hunsecker, an acrid gossip columnist fashioned after Winchell. Hunsucker might very well go down in history as one of the most repellent characters to grace the screen. Vindictive and bitter, Hunsecker's disturbing fixation on his own sister, the 19-year-old Susan (Susan Harrison), who's fallen for musician Steve Dallas (Martin Milner), adds a nauseating layer to the film.Yet, the film's principal focus lands on Sidney Falco (Tony Curtis), who relies on Hunsucker to disseminate his press releases for his clients. Falco, subject to Hunsecker's whims, is saddled with the absurd task of severing the bond between the sister and the decent Dallas, whom Hunsucker deems unworthy of his sibling.While Falco endures Hunsecker's vitriol for the sake of his career, one can't help but ponder if anyone would willingly subject themselves to such degradation. But press on he does, succumbing to Hunsecker's ""last chance"" ultimatum to break the couple apart.It's worth noting that the film boasts not a single sympathetic character; they're either morally bankrupt and vicious or hapless victims. Falco resorts to bribing another columnist with sexual favors courtesy of a cigarette girl he's acquainted with. The columnist proceeds to smear Dallas, labelling him a drug user and Communist, triggering his expulsion from the jazz band he performs in.Susan, caught in a web of incestuous insinuations from her brother, reluctantly terminates her relationship with Steve.Even the law enforcement officers in this twisted tale are tainted, arresting Dallas for marijuana possession at Hunsecker's behest, after Falco plants drugs in his pocket at a nightclub. Dallas ends up hospitalized, beaten by the very police who should protect him.As expected, both Hunsecker and Falco eventually receive their reckoning. When Falco intervenes to prevent Susan from jumping out of her apartment window, Hunsecker storms in, misconstruing Falco's actions as an attempt to molest his sister.Falco's comeuppance arrives via Hunsecker, who calls the police to reveal Falco's role in framing Dallas. Meanwhile, Susan chooses to return to Steve, serving Hunsecker his well-earned slice of humble pie.Both Lancaster and Curtis grapple with roles that amount to sleazy caricatures of real people.Even when dissenting with a public figure's politics, it's imperative to render a nuanced portrayal. People tend to forget that Winchell was among the few journalists who boldly denounced Hitler and opposed isolationism prior to World War II. Regardless of his later questionable stances during the McCarthy era, the attempt to besmirch him through the vile depiction of Hunsucker here is deplorable.The film's only redeeming facet is its on-location cinematography in New York City. Beyond that, the pervasive repulsiveness of the characters, devoid of any attempt at humanization, serves as an unmistakable clue that this film bears little resemblance to reality.",27 August 2023

",10,"By now, we're familiar with many classic movies that were a box office dud in their day, only to find its reputations ~and audiences~ grow over the years. CITIZEN KANE and IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE are the two most obvious examples, but there are many more. THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER, Buster Keaton's THE GENERAL, VERTIGO, PATHS OF GLORY, and Erich von Stroheim's classic silent GREED all suffered from the stigma of public indifference until posterity came along to vindicate them. THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is the most recent example I can think of, greeted with a ho-hum response during its theatrical run until word of mouth following its release on home video took it to a level that even its creators never saw coming.SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS was another misunderstood gem that contained big stars (Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis), but also had an acrid plot and badly flawed characters which was too strong for 1957 audiences. Like the other films I mentioned, SWEET SMELL eventually took on a life of its own, later to become a Tony winning Broadway play in the 1990's.SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS was the brainchild of writer Ernest Lehman, future scribe of NORTH BY NORTHWEST, who later adapted WEST SIDE STORY, THE SOUND OF MUSIC, and WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF. Lehman first wrote his treatment as a novella in the early Fifties while apprenticing as a press agent's assistant. He'd seen firsthand the dark side of celebrity culture, and there was no doubt that the character of J. J. Hunsecker was patterned after Walter Winchell, the foremost gossip columnist in America. Given SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS' sordid nature,Lehman knew that it was never going to make it to the silver screen without either a bankable star or an independent producer with a lot of moxey.....or both!!!!!Burt Lancaster was one of the first movie stars since the days of Fairbanks, Pickford, and Chaplin to take charge of his creative destiny by forming his own production company. With Harold Hill as his business partner, Lancaster shrewdly alternated his risky personal projects with sure-fire commercial hits to balance out his collateral in Hollywood.One of his first ventures as a businessman was a big screen version of Paddy Chayefsky's teleplay MARTY ~which he did not appear in. Its surprise success at the Oscars, which included Best Picture, strengthened his credentials as a producer. When SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS crossed his path, Lancaster wasn't sure if it was going to turn a profit....but he knew it had to be made!Directed by Alexander Mackendrick, best known for his Ealing comedies, SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS tells the story of J. J. Hunsecker and Sidney Falco. The megalomaniac Hunsecker is the most widely read gossip columnist in America, with his own weekly television show to complement his articles. Club 21 has a table reserved for him where he conducts his business and pleasure, and in most cases the two are mutually intertwined. With the power to make and break a career, he wields that power like a lightning rod. People are anxious not to be on his bad side, and shamelessly suck up to him.J. J.'s only kryptonite is his meek little sister Susie ~who looks young enough to be his daughter~ whom he controls so fiercely that she's terrified of antagonizing him. When she falls in love with Steve Dallas, a jazz musician who's the opposite of her brother in every way possible, Hunsecker puts on a phony façade of fraternal support while secretly trying to sabotage their relationship. This is where Sidney Falco comes in.Falco (Curtis) is a sleazy press agent who'll do anything to get his clients' names mentioned in Hunsecker's popular columns. He's so bottom rung that his office door doesn't have stenciling on the glass window, just a piece of paper pasted on it bearing his name in ink. Struggling to make his mark, Falco even resides in his workplace, complete with cot, because he can't afford a home of his own.Sidney is the proxy tasked by Hunsecker to break up Susie's romance, and his failure to accomplish this so far has him on J. J.'s no-contact list. I wondered why a big shot like Hunsecker would use someone as two-bit as Falco in the first place. Then I realized that his cruelty extends towards giving a desperate person a taste of the brass ring, then vindictively snatching it away when they fail to perform to his satisfaction.To get back into J. J.'s good graces, Falco uses one of Hunsecker's rivals to plant a false story about Steve being a communist sympathizer. By doing so, the libel can't be traced back to J. J. But the smear campaign only draws the lovers closer together than ever before, making Falco's position even more untenable.I'm not sure which Ealing film it was that convinced Lancaster and his producing partners to hire Mackendrick, but it was an exceptional decision. Of the many clever visual touches Mackendrick brought to SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS, my favorite is the one taking place on Hunsecker's balcony. Showing the back of Lancaster's head, the frame flawlessly illustrates the level of J. J.'s megalomania as he stands on the terrace high above as he surveys his neon fiefdom below. It uncomfortably calls to mind the photos of Hitler and Mussolini also basking in the idolatry of their subjects.Lancaster acquits himself very well as the evil Hunsecker, but it's Curtis who truly stands out as the amoral Falco. After years of pretty boy roles in scores of forgettable pictures, Curtis had a part that he could sink his teeth into and show everyone how good an actor he was. It was a performance that should have netted him an Oscar nomination.Thanks to the superb black & white photography by James Wong Howe, the high end locations of Manhattan's look just as seamy as any other borough in New York. SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS absolutely qualifies as one of those films you must see before you die. 🔚",4 March 2023
rw8730001,ur131764691,tt0051036," A film full of arsenic.
",10,"Throughout the history of the movies, we've seen many classics that were a box office dud in their day, only to see their reputations grow over the years. CITIZEN KANE and IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE are the two most obvious examples, but there are many more. THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER, Buster Keaton's THE GENERAL, PATHS OF GLORY, VERTIGO, and Erich von Stroheim's GREED also suffered from the stigma of public indifference until vindicated by posterity . THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is the most recent example I can think, greeted with a ho-hum response until word of mouth elevated its status completely. SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS was another misunderstood gem containing big name stars (Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis) and an acrid plot that was too strong for 1957 audiences. Like the other movies I mentioned, SWEET SMELL eventually took on a life of its own, becoming a Tony winning Broadway play in the 90s.SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS was the brainchild of writer Ernest Lehman, future scribe of NORTH BY NORTHWEST, WEST SIDE STORY, and THE SOUND OF MUSIC. He'd first written his treatment as a novella in the early Fifties apprenticing as a press agent's assistant. Lehman had seen the dark side of celebrity culture, and there was no doubt that SWEET SMELL's JJ Hunsecker was patterned after Walter Winchell, the foremost gossip columnist in America. Lehman knew that his story was never going to be seen on the silver screen without either a bankable star or an independent producer with a lot of moxie.....or both!Burt Lancaster was one of the first actors since the days of Chaplin, Fairbanks, and Pickford to take charge of his own creative destiny. He shrewdly alternated risky personal projects with surefire commercial hits to balance out his collateral in Hollywood. One of Lancaster's first ventures in that field was the big screen version of Paddy Chayefsky's MARTY -which he did not appear in. Its surprise success at the Oscars, which included Best Picture, considerably strengthened his credentials as a producer. When Lehman's screenplay crossed his path, Lancaster wasn't sure if it was going to turn a profit, but he knew it had to be made.Directed by Alexander Mackendrick, best known for his Ealing comedies, SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS tells the story of J. J. Hunsecker and Sidney Falco. The megalomaniac Hunsecker is the most widely read gossip columnist in America with his own television show. He's got his own table at Club 21 where he conducts business and pleasure, and in most cases the two are mutual. Wielding his power like it was a lightning rod, people are anxious not to get on his bad side and shamelessly suck up to him. J. J.'s only kryptonite is his meek little sister Susie -who looks young enough to be his daughter- whom he controls so fiercely that she's terrified of antagonizing him. When she falls in love with a jazz musician who's the opposite of her brother in every way possible, Hunsecker puts on a phony façade of fraternal support while secretly trying to sabotage the relationship. This is where Sidney Falco comes in.Falco (Curtis) is a sleazy press agent who'll do anything to get his clients' names mentioned in Hunsecker's widely read columns. He's so bottom rung that his office door doesn't have stenciling on the glass window; just a piece of paper with his name pasted on it. He even lives in his workplace, too. Sidney is the proxy tasked by Hunsecker to break up Susie's romance, and his failure to accomplish this has him on J. J.'s blacklist. I wondered why a big shot like Hunsecker would use someone so two-bit as Falco. Then I realized that his cruelty extends towards giving desperate people a taste of the brass ring, then vindictively snatching it away when they fail to perform to his satisfaction.",11 December 2022

rw9513549,ur174638476,tt0099348," A superb, sensitive beautiful film
",8,"A superbly directed film here from Kevin Costner, who probably was at the peak of his career with this film. Costner here plays another clean cut hero, the story is actually quite easy to follow which again I think is another credit to him. It has some really good cinematography and creative use of interesting camera angles, right from the opening of two armies facing off against each other. The use of the landscape is also very impressive, you truly feel the vastness of the earth, the sky, the details are also very well done on the uniforms of the soldiers, the dirty faces, the long beards, the dusty boots, the colours also look nice and natural. Costner narrates the film too and I wasn't sure that he needed to, it might have been more interesting to figure out for ourselves what the character was thinking and feeling. The story that develops is one of at first reluctant and then later great friendship and trust between the Costner character as a lonely solider manning an outpost and the local Indian tribe nearby. The film takes great care to show us the culture and individual attributes and traits of the characters in the tribe and you really come to like many of them, you also like the Costner character a very resourceful and plucky guy. The film never gets too sweet and mushy though, there's a great deal of patience to it, communication and building trust takes time and it's not always easy, misunderstandings and mishaps can be common. There is a trilling scene showing a buffalo hunt which is perhaps the standout of the movie, it's one of great spectacle. The film doesn't show all native Americans as simply peaceful and wise, another tribe in flashbacks and the present commits attacks and atrocities and you know there's going to be a big showdown at the end. By this point you've totally forgotten it's not the late 19th century, it's so real, the art direction and costumes are excellent, everything has a worn used look to it. Over time our hero also become the hero in the eyes of the Indians he's befriended and gets a new name and goes so far as to become almost native. There's lovely scenes of camp fires late into the night where characters exchange stories and reminisce. We also have a gentle inquisitive wolf in the story and it was great to see a time when real animals were still used in movies and not CGI birds and bears. There's romance too with Costner falling for a white woman taken in by the tribe when after she became an orphan. Where the film starts not to work is where after a superb scene that gently hints at the decline of the natives with Costner telling them more white people will come than there are stars in the sky and the reminder of the Spanish conquest of the land centuries earlier. The film really should end here but it goes on instead for another 30 minutes. Costner returns to his base only to find if full of petty, bigoted, jingoistic men, crude and uneducated. All the subtle distinctions given to the natives is not applied here. There's a sort of rescue mission though, the natives flee to the mountains, in a scene I couldn't believe the rest of the army then sets off after Costner, I really doubt he'd be their top priority at that time. Overall though a very good film, spoiled by that final 30 minutes.",23 December 2023

rw9471240,ur0225436,tt0099348," Sympathetic View of Native American Culture Occasionally Veers into Hagiographical and Anachronistic Territory
",6,"""Dances with Wolves"" has garnered acclaim for its endeavor to present a more sympathetic view of Native American culture within the Western genre. Nevertheless, criticisms abound, with some asserting that the film veers into idealization and hagiography, simplifying the complexities of Native American cultures and histories into noble stereotypes. Kevin Costner's character, John Dunbar, further draws scrutiny as a potential ""white savior"" figure, eclipsing the opportunity for a Sioux character to assume the primary perspective.The film, a significant cultural production challenging prevailing stereotypes, underscores the ongoing need for accurate and nuanced representations of Indigenous peoples in media. A notable flaw in the film lies in its oversight of accurately representing gender differences in dialogue. Russell Means, a prominent Native American activist during that period, found amusement in Kevin Costner's portrayal, as he observed the actor speaking in a manner that inadvertently incorporated a feminine dialect. This oversight became a source of unintended humor for Means, highlighting a noteworthy inaccuracy in the film's linguistic portrayal of Native American characters.The character of John Dunbar in ""Dances with Wolves"" has been subject to discussions regarding whether he can be seen as an anachronistic representation, projecting contemporary white guilt about the mistreatment of Native Americans onto a historical character. Some argue that Dunbar's sympathetic and idealized portrayal reflects modern sensibilities more than the attitudes of the time in which the film is set. His rapid integration into the Lakota Sioux community and the central role he plays in their lives raise questions about the believability of his character within the context of the film's historical setting.The ensemble of Sioux characters, including Kicking Bird (Graham Greene), Wind in His Hair (Rodney A. Grant), Ten Bears (Floyd Red Crow Westerman), and Stands With a Fist (Mary McDonnell), contributes to the film's richness. Each character offers insights into different facets of Sioux culture, presenting a mosaic that reflects the challenges faced by Native American communities during the era of westward expansion. Stands With a Fist's role as a translator and eventual love interest for Dunbar adds a unique perspective to the cultural clashes depicted.""Dances with Wolves"" has been criticized for its portrayal of the Pawnee as antagonists, as it perpetuates a simplistic and often negative stereotype of this Native American tribe. While the film depicts conflicts between the Sioux and the Pawnee, it's important to note that historical relationships between Native American tribes were complex, and no single narrative can accurately capture the diverse interactions and dynamics.In historical reality, intertribal conflicts were common among Native American groups. The Pawnee did face challenges from various neighboring tribes, including the Sioux, but it's an oversimplification to label one tribe as solely victims or villains. These interactions were shaped by factors such as competition for resources, territorial disputes, and cultural differences.The portrayal of the Pawnee as aggressors in ""Dances with Wolves"" reflects the film's adherence to certain Western genre conventions, where conflict and tension are often framed in clear-cut terms of heroes and villains. However, historical accuracy and nuance are often sacrificed for the sake of cinematic storytelling.The film's depiction of the Sioux as victims reflects a deliberate narrative choice, spotlighting the detrimental impact of westward expansion on Native American communities. However, it's crucial to acknowledge the complexity of historical events, such as the Dakota War of 1862, which, although not directly part of the film's narrative, adds layers to the discussion. The conflict involved some Dakota Sioux, frustrated by broken treaties, unfair treatment, and starvation, engaged in violent uprisings against white settlers and U. S. government authorities, underscoring the multifaceted nature of historical intertribal dynamics.While ""Dances with Wolves"" is often praised for its attempt to offer a more sympathetic portrayal of Native American characters, discussions about its representation of white characters, particularly soldiers, highlight the need for more nuanced and balanced portrayals in historical storytelling.In ""Dances with Wolves,"" Kevin Costner delivers a performance that adheres to the Hollywood hero mold, embodying the transformational journey of a protagonist caught between cultures during a pivotal period in American history. While his portrayal may not deviate significantly from traditional hero archetypes, the film's enduring impact is buoyed by its remarkable cinematography and a captivating musical score.",3 December 2023

rw9467322,ur110212703,tt0099348," Boring but pretty
",4,"Kevin Costner's directorial debut, Dances with Wolves, is the exact kind of sweeping epic that Hollywood wasn't really making all that much anymore. A throwback to another time when the Western was king, it's a revisionist text that takes Michael Blake's source novel (from a screenplay he wrote), and makes the West...immensely boring. I was reminded of a lot while watching this, from Terrence Malick's Badlands to John Ford's The Searchers to Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter, but it mostly reminded me of simplistic moral fables one tells to children dressed up in grown up clothes and stretched out to four hours.Lieutenant John Dunbar (Costner) gets injured in a Civil War battle in Tennessee, decides that he'd rather die in a blaze of glory than have his leg cut off, miraculously survives being shot at by Confederate troops, and provides the right kind of distraction for the Union army to take advantage and win the small skirmish. As a reward for his bravery, the general ensures that Dunbar's leg will get fixed up and that he'll get his choice of assignment. His choice ends up being as far West as he's allowed to go into the Plains of the American countryside.Now, I should note that I haven't seen this film in years, and I ended up watching the extended cut which is almost an hour longer than the theatrical cut. I went through the differences at the end of the film as listed online in order to get a grasp of where my problems originated and if they would have been endemic to the theatrical cut, and there's a moment here, when John gets his assignment from Major Fambrough (Maury Chaykin) where the commanding officer comes off like this complete loon and ends up shooting himself. It's so brief, incidental to the actual action, and so overdone that it threw me, and I saw that it was added in the extended cut. Keep that sucker on the cutting room floor, Costner. I think it's supposed to show the strain of living out there, but the performance by Chaykin is so self-consciously crazy that it feels out of place.Anyway, Dunbar gets to his assignment of Fort Sedgwick, abandoned and rundown, and he sets out to rebuild it while reestablishing the base. This is, of course, where the Indian tribes begin to get introduced. The first is actually a small group of Pawnee, their leader (Wes Studi), killing the man who drove Dunbar to the fort. It creates this sense of danger in the beginning that Dunbar doesn't understand where he is, heightened by the moment (in the extended cut) where Dunbar takes a group of rotting deer and burns it, creating this stack of smoke that's supposed to be a dangerous sign to someone like the Pawnee, and the editing is confusing implying that the Pawnee see it. However, they only end up attacking the guide, never approaching Dunbar and Fort Sedgwick, and the Pawnee disappear for more than two hours.He's soon visited by a Sioux medicine man, Kicking Bird (Graham Greene), and they begin a very limited communication since neither of them speak each other's language. Kicking Bird convinces his tribe to let him try this communication, and it's these scenes of two cultures meeting that first reminded me of the later The New World before steadily recalling Terrence Malick's long history of using Eden as a motif in his stories. It's kind of cute, but it all gets cut short when Kicking Bird convinces the white woman who's been living with them since she was a child, Stands with a Fist (Mary McDonnell), and the whole communication thing becomes more of a curio to the story instead of an actual hurdle. He learns Sioux, she relearns English, and you have a romance! But, actually communicating ideas is no longer a challenge.The bulk of the film is this idyllic portrait of Sioux life on the plains, and the extended cut has one moment that I really like that the rest of the film forgets because it was easily excised and interfered with the overall love-fest of the Sioux. An early plot point is that the Sioux are waiting for the buffalo that are late in the season. First of all, why do they care? I would imagine the buffalo are a main source of food and clothing for them, but there's never a sign of starvation or even hunger. It's just a generalized desire to have the buffalo around as presented in the film. Secondly, they take it really badly when they see the discarded corpses of several dozen buffalo on the plains which Dunbar helps them find. They're so mad that, in the reconstituted scene, they scalp the white men who did it and celebrate the kills as Dunbar has his voiceover about how there's still this distance between them. It ends up the only scene that remotely puts the Sioux in a bad light...and it was cut from the theatrical version.This overly idyllic portrait ends up becoming excessively boring, though. That's the main problem. There is no drama. No one is starving. There's no danger from war (though the warriors go off to fight it twice, first against the Utes and second against the Pawnee), but the life of the people left behind are never inconvenienced. It's like a vacation. Their lives are perfect, and perfection ends up kind of boring after a while, and it's all in service of the romance between Dunbar, who gains the name Dances with Wolves when he's observed dancing with a wolf around his fire at Fort Sedgwick, and Stands with a Fist. It's only very late in the film when the Pawnee attack the village itself, but Dunbar is able to get rifles without much trouble, making the fight one-sided and simple.Really, this is a story for children.And it's made all the worse when the Army finally decides to show up at Fort Sedgwick. This is where Costner and Blake go full stereotype and caricature to the point where one unnamed soldier uses the page from Dunbar's journal where he says that he loves Stands with a Fist as toilet paper. That's just ham-fisted right there.Ultimately, my problem with the film is that it's too simplistic a take on the life of the Sioux to be interesting for four hours. There's precious little conflict through large stretches, and when the conflict does come it's either too easily dispatched or too cartoonish to take seriously. Also, Kevin Costner's performance is wooden, his voiceover is stilted, and there's often little contrasts between what he's describing in the voiceover and his performance on screen, talking about big emotions but Costner is just kind of looking around, making it obvious that the voiceover was necessary to tell the story because Costner couldn't carry the emotional realities necessary for the performance on his own.I will say this, though, Costner made a great choice of simply filming outside. It's something I wish more filmmakers would do because it becomes easy to get a pleasant frame by just putting a character in the foreground and the epic sight of the American countryside in the background. It's consistently pretty, and the music by John Barry has some nice themes to it.I didn't hate it. It's pretty. The performances from almost everyone else, especially McDonnell, are pretty good, making Costner's plank of wood reactions to everything slightly less of an issue, and it's got a decent score. I like the idea of the look at the life of the Sioux, even if it doesn't feel terribly realistic, and, again, it looks pretty good. Beating Goodfellas, though? I'm convinced that the actors were just throwing their weight around, happy to award any of their troupe that directed movies that got enough producer attention to get a nomination.",1 December 2023

Maybe the director was establishing that his destiny is to be gained without injury against incredible danger. A metaphor for Manifest Destiny?The scene where the Sioux encircle the Pawnee Chief and simultaneously shoot without bullets hitting anyone on the other side of the circle?

At the end John finds love with Stands With a Fist, and Two Socks return. Overall I enjoyed this because it was hooking towards the end.

This version is a slight variant from a pre-release 1945 rendition seen by U.

Vivian (Lauren Bacall), in her 20s, is widowed and living back in her father's home. Carmen (Martha Vickers), the younger daughter, has a drug problem and is entirely irresponsible. She has considerable debts to bookstore owner, A. G. Geiger (Theodore von Eltz).After being intercepted by Vivian before leaving the Sternwood house, Marlowe begins to pursue Geiger. The film then follows Marlowe sorting out the disappearance of a recent Sternwood employee, two complex blackmail cases, and an increasing series of murders in which the links are unclear. A significant player is gambler Eddie Mars (John Ridgely), whom Vivian protects from Marlowe even as their own relationship heats up.""The Big Sleep"" is a classic film noir. The dialogue is clipped 1940s tough guy. The sizzle between Bogart and Bacall is similar to that in ""To Have and Have Not."" They married soon after ""The Big Sleep"" was completed. It's a complex plot, and some characters like Agnes Lowzier (Sonia Darrin) and Harry Jones (Elisha Cook) appear and disappear almost too quickly.

As the only hearing member of a deaf family we find out that she's spent a lot of her life since an early age having to translate and interrupt for her family when their out and about. Perhaps unfairly they've come to heavily rely on her whether at work or elsewhere. Things change though when she's motivated to join a school choir which takes her off in a whole new direction. She's actually a good singer though shy and awkward. The acting is actually really good, the slouched posture, downcast head and grungy clothes all convey this sense of awkwardness and fatigue. It's hinted that she's not had much time in her life to play and be free when growing up, she also struggles to connect with her mother who mistrusts their outside community. The film packs quite a punch and there's also an interesting subplot about difficulties with the family's fishing business and their fight against the big man who's pretty soon going to put them out of business. The film wonderfully captures the sense of warmth and also awkwardness in families, the way parents embarrass their children, the way children can embarrass their parents. The conflict though between dreams of a music scholarship and staying behind to help her parents becomes the central conflict of the film. Another interesting character is a passionate music teacher who devotes time to our lead character to help her follow her dreams. The music, lighting, editing are all great without ever becoming distracting or taking away from the performances or story. I feel that's really their proper function and too many filmmakers have forgotten that and made the characters and story come second too often. The story is set squarely in a film town and it's not until the very end that we finally find ourselves in a big city. The film has it's share of tropes, crowd pleasing moments and so on but there's a freshness and rawness to it that means you don't really mind actually. It's largely down to our main character who comes across as attractive, likeable, shy and just very natural and real. The film while largely about music is not afraid to use silence too to give us the other perspective. It also subtly explores the ways in which deaf people are often excluded from being able to do basic things. The love story is also very sweet in a simple uncynical kind of way.",23 December 2023

His chance encounter with the enigmatic and charismatic Tyler Durden, portrayed by Brad Pitt, leads to the creation of an underground fight club as an outlet for repressed male aggression and dissatisfaction.Fincher's direction injects the film with a gritty and frenetic energy, reflecting the chaos and disillusionment of the characters' lives.

",9,"As society gradually progresses towards more inclusive and diverse notions of gender and masculinity, it becomes increasingly important to question what it means to be a man. The rigid expectations of traditional manhood no longer hold true for many of us. It is time to embrace a new definition of masculinity that is not based on outdated stereotypes of strength and dominance. Instead of clinging to outdated notions of masculinity, we should embrace change and work towards creating a more inclusive and accepting society. The movie Fight Club serves as a powerful satire that highlights the dangers of clinging to outdated notions of masculinity and the need for men to redefine what it means to be a man in the modern world.Fight Club is unequivocally one of the densest and most intriguing American films of all time, and it is also relentlessly entertaining. It surpasses the book by making more sense and cutting to the essence of the story. The film perfectly captures the way society has made it difficult to find value and how consumerism has enslaved us, leaving us emasculated as we replace spiritual needs with material goods. This creates a meaningless existence and a numb society where everyone is out of touch with their feelings, and we are all just passive observers of the world around us.Fight Club observes men who have found no worth in their lives and playfully challenges them to explore alternative values. They would fight to feel something, to keep themselves in check, and to achieve their ideal selves. They would reject the modern society that they feel coddles and restricts them, and they would have a nostalgia for patriarchy. However, these values are dangerous, without love or compassion, and the film ultimately rejects the fascist parts of the movement it depicts. The modern world may leave you unfulfilled, but accepting who you are and finding others to care about is a much better cure than dying for hypermasculine ideals. We need to move forward and improve, not just reset to zero.Fight Club is an outstanding movie that stands out among the rest. Its audacious and darkly humorous tone makes it an absolute delight to watch despite its extreme approach. The film delves deeply into male intimacy, with gay undertones and double entendres adding an extra layer of depth to the story. The narration is unparalleled, featuring surreal descriptions and quirky wit that are unmatched in cinema. Fight Club is a large-budget Hollywood movie that tackles film topics in an unconventional way while still being grand in scale and filled with expensive visual effects. The cinematography is striking, giving everything a shiny yet damp appearance that is truly one-of-a-kind. Thematically and stylistically, the movie is incredibly creative and unique, standing out from the crowd.

For a movie called fight club you'd think there would be more than a small handful of fights. You're mostly getting a shirtless Brad Pitt going around smoking cigarettes, meaning that the lead actor is either the worst casting ever as I can't take him seriously for even a second as the character is so lame and geeky like if you took out all spidermans powers from the first spiderman movie with Toby Maguire in it. That or Edward was an absolutely brilliant casting choice from the director as his job seems to amplifies Brad's late 90s coolness. Brad is so cool he goes around wearing whatever he wants, doing whatever he wants and is the opposite of the lead. Seriously go watch Wanted (2008) with Angelina Jolie instead it's a way better movie with a similar premise with the lead. Or possibly Limitless with Bradley Cooper from The Hangover trilogy.The movie is too long. I feel it could have started where Brad Pitt and Edward Norton's characters meet on the plane with a few flash backs as this movie is a chore to sit through.

Can Wayne and just two slightly unreliable deputies hold out that long?There's loads of nice details in the film, Wayne as this tough and respected lawman, the Mexican couple who run the hotel and bar in the town, a nice touch to see a Mexican couple included in an American Western of this period. There's great cosy scenes of the men hanging out in their lockup, new arrivals in town being forced to surrender their weapons, the lawmen patrolling the town in the evening with a strong sense of danger lurking around every corner. The cinematography is nice and keeps things simple. One character is an alcoholic and we get a good little bit of character development for him over the course of the film. John Wayne though as just so macho and he does have good chemistry with who ever he's in a scene with. The town created is fairly convincing, with the dusty roads, the salons, bars, jail, everything we've come to expect from a western. Quite a deal happens over the course of the movie and there's all the while this looming threat that a jail break might be about to happen. The film also has a love interest for John Wayne and she's a great character, coy, warm, funny, intelligent and dazzling beautiful. There's a nice edge to the film too with the villains ordering the local bar musicians to play music as a sign that is about to overtake our heroes. I thought all the costumes and props and sets looked good, no issues there, there's some nice character develop as mentioned with a sad drunk character battling for self-esteem. It's nice to also have some smart villains for a change too, they actually have a plan and can also think on their feet too which is refreshing. This is a film with all the great western classic elements, the tough respected lawman battling to defend his town, the dazzlingly attractive and alluring saloon girl, the big shootout at the end, the clear cut good v bad story, the details of the town itself, the killers for hire, the battle of law v chaos, I can see why this is such a classic. There's some nice relaxed humour to the film too, the 3 lawman and the new arrival have this great sense of affection and warmth for each other which does shine through.

He also felt more human, he gets knocked out in the first 5 minutes of the movie and then shows up a couple of minutes later to arrest the suspect while being dazed and blood streaming down his face was pretty powerful.There was a lot of great things about this movie but what I found the most interesting is how the movie dealt with Dean Martin's character's alcohol addiction. It's the first movie I've seen from this era that actually addresses any kind of addiction, but the way they handled it was more reminiscent of movies made today. John's character empowers and lifts Dean's character up to give him the strength to fight his addiction.

It blends the scenery with a recreated Western town perfectly.Dino Crocetti uses great body language and verbal delivery in numerous scenes. Arguably he steals the limelight significantly from lead actor Marion Morrison.Although Morrison has decent chemistry with leading lady Angie Brown, the age difference does feel noticeable and slightly distracting, as is often the case in older movies with a romantic theme. Brown is excellent throughout.Great support is offered by Walter Brennan, Ward Bond and Pedro Gonzalez Gonzalez. The casting of Ricky Nelson is all wrong, but he puts in a solid, likeable performance if you can accept the concept of a teen idol acting the part of a gunslinger who sounds like a seasoned veteran.I have mixed feelings on the musical scene. I do think it feels jarring and out of place, but in the same breath it is brilliantly staged and highly enjoyable. As a standalone scene, it is one of the best in the movie.As for the political debate surrounding the comparisons with High Noon, I would rather keep away from that topic as it detracts from the enjoyment of two very different, but classic film experiences.

The films flaw is in its premise itself- it seemed quite improbable that the police would believe a raving lunatic over a sane man, and that planting a lighter days after a murder can possibly be much admissible evidence to convict and try Haines. The film is also oddly structured, in that the plot moves rather slowly in the middle hour or so, and the true climax of the film, the really suspenseful, thrilling bits are the last 30 minutes of film. I find that Hitchcocks movies can be so,it into two kinds- action adventure espionage tales normally with a bit of wit and humour in them(North By Northwest, thirty nine steps, lady vanishes) or more serious thrillers with excellent dramatic acting(Notorious, Man Who Knew Too Much, Vertigo). Strangers On A Train falls squarely into the latter category, but its plot lacks enough tension, and its characters lack enough interpersonal relationships to truly ground and humanise the story. Notorious had a serious love story, Man Who Knew Too Much a family kidnapping story, and Vertigo and obsessive love story. Perhaps this film is most similar to Rope, but I find Rope to be more tautly constructed and more suspenseful. Of course, strangers on a train does have outstanding performances, notably the chilling, psychopathic portrayal of Bruno. It also has beautiful cinematography by Robert Burks.

",7,"I watched ""Strangers on a Train"" once before and remember, while certainly feeling entertained, not being particularly crazy about it back then. In revisiting the film as part of my Hitchcock marathon, expectations were high, considering its esteemed reputation for being one of the director's best works. Although my understanding of Hitchcock's cinematic language and appreciation of his visual inventiveness has grown since that first viewing, the overall impact of the film, unfortunately, still didn't resonate as strongly with me as it seems to do with almost everybody else.As has been highlighted by many others, the movie boasts several brilliant set pieces that showcase Hitchcock's filmmaking brilliance. I think about the whole murder sequence, from the misdirection in the tunnel, using shadows and screams, to the actual deed being viewed through the lenses of the victim's broken glasses. Later, there's some intricate crosscutting between scenes of a tennis match and a character reaching for his lighter in the sewer, which elevates these ordinary activities to an almost unbearable level of suspense. The film's climax at the carnival is another testament to Hitch's ability to create high levels of tension from seemingly innocuous settings.In ""Strangers on a Train"", rich-kid-with-daddy(-and-mommy)-issues (a Hitchcock trademark) Bruno Anthony approaches tennis pro Guy Haines with his theory for committing the ""perfect murder"" (another director trademark). One of the film's strengths lies in the performance of Robert Walker: he portrays Bruno Anthony as a charming, manipulative playboy who is gradually revealed to be a full-blown lunatic.However, in my opinion, the narrative falls short in fully exploring the potential of the intriguing premise (the ""murder swap""). Hitchcock's best works usually add some element of (moral or other) ambiguity, complex psychology or a plot twist that completely upends our perspective and the way we think of certain characters. ""Strangers on a Train"" doesn't have that additional layer of complication. The characters lack the depth and complexity that elevate Hitchcock's best works. Bruno Anthony is a psychopathic villain without any redeeming qualities (and a possible Oedipus complex). Guy Haines, in equally straightforward manner, is presented as an uncomplicated hero: he doesn't seriously consent with Bruno's plan for the murder swap, even though his wife is clearly shown to be a manipulative monster who cuckolds him. Guy is an upstanding citizen who just had the bad fortune of meeting the wrong stranger on the wrong train, his innocence never in doubt.In the Hitchcock's pantheon, ""Strangers on a Train"" falls into the mid-tier for me. While I could better appreciate the technical finesse this time around, the film ultimately failed to really strike a chord with me beyond its visual bravura. The absence of extra intrigue, whether through engaging character development, interesting thematic elements, or unexpected plot twists, prevents it from being in the upper echelon of Hitchcock's work, occupied by classics like ""Vertigo"", ""Psycho"", ""Rebecca"", ""Notorious"", or the in many ways similar, but more richly layered, ""Rope"". Despite some captivating moments , ""Strangers on a Train"" remains a film where the technical brilliance outshines the narrative and thematic depth.",13 December 2023

",1,"I""ve seen Rio Bravo twice, now. Once, in the theater in '59 when I was 9 years old (my brother and I would go to the movies every Saturday matinee, no matter what was playing), and recently, digitally on Amazon. I don't remember what I thought when I was a kid, but watching recently was the longest three hours of my life. Fortunately, with the streamed version I was able to fast forward past the fifth or sixth love scene with Angie and John Wayne. I'm sorry, Duke, and Howard (oh, so sorry..MR. Hawks) but this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.I understand (sort of) the reverence, and canonizing of John Wayne, Howard Hawks, 1950s westerns, and ""classic movies"", and people can soliloquize about the greatness of it all, and how ""they don't make 'em like that anymore"". But I challenge anyone to watch Rio Bravo all the way through without your mind wandering about what you have to do for work the next day.I don't buy into the ""John Wayne"" as untouchable icon. He may have been a superstar cowboy seventy-five years ago, defined the American western movie genre and was hugely popular, ..but that was ..seventy five years ago. And, like a seventy five year old condom, it just doesn't hold up.Wayne was a lot of things, but he wasn't an actor. Or a cowboy, or Davy Crockett, a Colonel, or a Green Beret. He was, though great at branding himself as the ""tough guy"". As we know, branding can be powerful, and career producing, and a lot of people buy it to it. Sometimes it makes unqualified people President.I'm not a fan of John Wayne, I admit ( he's not so much an actor, as much as he is John Wayne DOING John Wayne in every picture he's ever done since The Big Trail), but there are some decent John Wayners..Stage Coach, The Searchers, True Grit, The Shootist, etc.,. But Rio Bravo must of been the start of his gratuitous, sleepwalking, cashing-in-on-the-name period. Hey, I would.And what's with all the love scenes? In a (shall I say..better?) movie there may be a tender moment or two, but here we have one after another, after another. Talk, talk, talk. Guys, this isn't radio. Movies are a visual medium. Dammit. Isn't a western supposed to be full of horse chases, and shoot em up? In this interminable opera even the ""action"" scenes are slow as tree sap in the dead of winter. What we have here is a twenty minute story told in three hours.Walter Brennan as ""Stumpy"" ( maybe the only real actor in this movie) adds well done comic relief, as does the stereotypical Mexican comic Gonzalez Gonzalez, but the relief is not enough relief to keep the average discerning viewer's attention.Ricky Nelson? Really? Hot stuff at the time, and (so the producers say) he added two million to the gross profit, but are you making a movie or Here Come The Nelsons Live at the Ranch?Dean Martin, bless his heart, tries really hard, but I kept waiting for Jerry Lewis to come running down the street with his guns around his ankles. And you would think Martin playing a drunk would be an Oscar winning walk in the park cinch.Dean and Ricky are couple of my favorite singers, but what was that gratuitous jailhouse musicale all about? Let me add, that Dimitri Tiomkin is one of my favorite film composers, but this main theme sung by Martin must have been written when Dimitri when he wasn't feeling well. AT LEAST give us a decent theme to hum later.C'mon you guys (I'm looking at you Tarantino, (who said this is one of the greatest movie ever made), this is...something other than great.

",8,"Rio Bravo, director Howard Hawks' masterpiece, is the film which epitomises and is emblematic of the western genre as a whole. It takes all the finest qualities of the genre and blends it together to create an entertaining, immersive experience. Rio Bravo, unlike other acclaimed westerns like high noon or Man Who Shot Liberty valence, does not attempt to do anything new of reinvent the genre- everything which we expect in a western is inside, nothing more nothing less, but perfectly executed. The film is rich with atmosphere created from distinctive, well acted characters who are brimming with personality. John Wayne headlines the cast with perhaps the most ""John Wayne' performance yet- he is immensely likeable, charismatic, and never puts a foot wrong in his performance. The rest of the supporting cast are also full of flavour and they are always endearing and unambiguously good. Dean Martin adds emotional depth to the film as a drunk who loathes himself, Ricky Nelson as a self assured kid, and Walter Brennan as a cripple whose babbling may be alternately annoying and adorable. Perhaps the strength and appeal of Rio Bravo lies with this- it is an unabashedly optimistic, warm film which warms the heart. While the Audience probably knows the ending to this largely predictable film, it is the journey which matters. We do not care much that justice prevails in the end. What matters for us is that our characters get what they want. We want Chance to get the girl, Dude to overcome his drinking problem, Colorado to join the sheriff, and Stumpy to prove he is not a useless old cripple. The plot in the film is quite immaterial- it merely acts as a conduit for our affection for these characters. The shoot outs in the film do not exist to really propel the plot forward. They serve only to entertain us, so we can watch our favourite characters suavely gun down baddies. This warmth, this camaraderie between characters in the film is what really gives Rio Bravo lots of heart. It recognises that the western, at its core, is about satisfaction and warmth, about likeable characters over cliched gunfights. The dialogue in the film also deserves praise- Howard Hawks is fantastic at writing good dialogue, and his skills shine through here. The film is unusually witty for a western, and a famous line ""I'm hard to get, you just have to ask"" is recycled from his earlier feature Only Angels Have Wings. The witty dialogue rich with implied meaning and subtext helps add comedy, and warmth to this film. Rio Bravo stands tall as one of the defining examples of what every western wants to be. It's is funny, sweet, and warm rather than dour, abstruse, or philosophical. While it may be a bit long for some, this film is so easily likeable that I doubt many would mind.

The film masterfully weaves a web of suspense and moral ambiguity as Guy, initially dismissive of Bruno's bizarre proposal, becomes ensnared in a spiral of crime orchestrated by Bruno himself.

The psychological power play between him and Guy highlights the fine line between influence and control.

The idea upon which the crime plot, concocted by the brilliant Patricia Highsmith, is based is so simplistic and universal that it has an inherent elegance: Two men meet on a train and contemplate the idea of ""swapping murders"". That one of them may take it all a little more seriously than the other creates the basis for the playful perversities that ensue. As with almost all of Hitchcock's movies, the story invites several moral discussions and thematic ambivalences, which the director naturally exploits both narratively and visually. Hitchcock and his cinematographer Robert Burks, who worked together for the first time here, take full advantage of the array of possibilities black-and-white cinematography offers, not least by use of shadows and juxtapositions. These visual hints and suggestions aren't seminal, but they give the story a little extra zest. And they are part and parcel of how Hitchcock ambushes you in his subtle, sneaky way. You cannot help but be taken by Robert Walker's Bruno - even identify with him and his degenerate selfishness. Strangers on a Train is in many ways a much simpler film than other Hitchcock masterpieces such as Vertigo or North by Northwest, but it's a psychological portrait of timeless proportions.

I love the positive messages of this film and I love how it compares with the cynical 22. This movie is simply amazing and I recommend anyone to watch this. The only issues with this film is it's a bit dark for some kids and the messages won't really resonate with them.

She like shim, he likes her - then an accident befalls and in best ""Matter of Life and Death"" tradition, he is on a conveyor belt to the afterlife.

What ensues now are a series of characterful escapades that see them flirt with rebirth (only in swapped bodies) but that ultimately cause both to re-assess what their priorities are. Of course there's some moralising - it's Disney - but that is delivered quite subtly and wrapped in some entertainingly witty dialogue and some - though not enough - gorgeous jazz.

",7,"The Best Animated Feature Oscar winner at the 93rd Academy Awards, Soul was Pixar's 2020 release about an aspiring jazz musician who accidentally ends up in the afterlife and desperately tries to make his way back in time for the most important concert of his life.Set in New York City, the film sees Joe (voiced by Jamie Foxx), a music teacher who is given the opportunity by an ex-student to work with jazz legend Dorothea Williams (Angela Bassett). Happy about finally being able to prove himself as a worthy jazz pianist, Joe sets his sights on the audition and the upcoming music club show. Unfortunately, in his mindless jubilation, he missteps into a manhole in the middle of the street and finds his soul transported onto a bridge in an in-between world, heading towards a light. Joe quickly understands that death is what awaits him at the end of the tunnel so he sneaks out and finds himself in another part of that world trying to sneak back into his own body.This proves to not be such an easy task as he is appointed a quirky, rebellious protégée, a new soul known only as 22 (Tiny Fey) by the counsellors there. 22 has no interest in being sent to the real world so Joe is tasked with changing their mind by inspiring her to want to live. Joe, more concerned about his own reincarnation, instead uses 22 to get back to his body but, after a mixup, he ends up in the body of a cat instead, with 22 being the new Joe.As ever with Pixar, there's little to complain about here in terms of visuals. The animation is reliably stunning throughout and the Great Beyond, as well as the character design of its inhabitants, is creative and colorful. The story itself explores some really interesting existential questions and it does so with exactly the right amount of heart, humor and intelligence you'd expect from the animation studio.The film's tone does take a bold leap towards slapstick when Joe ends up in a cat's body and this might prove too silly for some, especially considering the deeper themes the movie attempts to talk about, but even those parts are handled with enough charm that they work. The film never strays from Joe and 22's character arcs so it allows itself some fun detours here and there, much in the same way that Coco never keeps its eye off the big tear-jerker moment it's ultimately going for but still manages to fit in some musical numbers and a murder mystery.Watching Soul, however, you can't help but feel like these are all roads we've seen Pixar drive down before. There's something very derivative about Soul, despite its undeniable creativity. While you could argue that the film is infinitely more about life than it is about death, the latter is definitely a big theme here and it feels like it has been for quite a few Pixar films by this point: Coco, Onward, Up, even Toy Story 3. The afterlife of Soul is also very reminiscent of the inner worlds from Inside Out. Soul's message, finding what makes you happy and going for it but not letting yourself get bogged down by your ""spark"", is a valid one but it would have been so much more powerful had this felt a lot less like a Pixar best-of.Frankly, you can see the wrap-up to the story coming a mile away and even the film's most unexpected event, the cat twist, feels instantly familiar. Thankfully, the characters are so well written (Graham Norton's hippie sign-twirler is especially good fun) and the visuals are so pretty that the film still makes for a good watch.Soul is a beautiful looking film with top-notch animation and an excellent cast. Pixar's reluctance to jump out of its comfort zone both stylistically and in terms of its storytelling, however, distracts from its thoughtful message and that's a bit of a shame, even if the film remains very solid and well worth watching. This should not be as predictable as it is but you won't have a bad time sitting through it.Not Pixar's best but still decent.",28 November 2023

This film, filled with unforgettable performances and a riveting plot, certainly merits a well-earned 8-star rating.The story revolves around Alicia Huberman (Ingrid Bergman), the daughter of a convicted Nazi spy, who is recruited by American intelligence agent T. R. Devlin (Cary Grant) to infiltrate a group of Nazis hiding in post-World War II Brazil. As Alicia becomes entangled in a web of espionage and danger, her growing affection for Devlin and the enigmatic Alex Sebastian (Claude Rains) complicates the mission.What sets ""Notorious"" apart is Hitchcock's masterful direction and his ability to create tension in even the most mundane of situations. The film's famous wine cellar sequence is a prime example of Hitchcock's knack for building suspense, and it remains one of cinema's most unforgettable moments.Ingrid Bergman's performance as Alicia is both vulnerable and resilient, making her character complex and engaging. Cary Grant, the epitome of suave charm, delivers a captivating portrayal of Devlin. Claude Rains' portrayal of Alex Sebastian adds depth to the film's morally ambiguous characters.The film explores themes of trust, sacrifice, and love, all within the high-stakes world of espionage. It cleverly blurs the lines between good and evil and questions the choices people make when driven by love and duty.""Notorious"" also benefits from the sharp and suspenseful script by Ben Hecht, which keeps the audience engaged from start to finish. The chemistry between the leads, particularly Grant and Bergman, adds depth to the film's romantic and emotional core.In conclusion, ""Notorious"" is a captivating espionage thriller with memorable performances and Hitchcock's trademark suspenseful direction. Its exploration of love, trust, and sacrifice within the world of espionage makes it a classic in the genre. With its enduring impact and captivating narrative, it confidently earns an 8-star rating.",26 October 2023

Heck, who am I supposed to be rooting for here, the ex-lover who would do anything for her while he associates with evil doing German scientists that treat her with respect and dignity (well, until the end of the film) or the hero federal agent she's in love with that keeps reminding her how ""fast"" she works when he gets upset with her.After thinking back about it this way, it's no wonder she's got a drinking problem; who wouldn't?Anyhow, despite even her romantic love (Cary Grant) making disparaging remarks to her, somehow I still believed that these characters care deeply about each other (I credit the acting of Ingrid Bergman over the writing and Cary's mostly mannequin performance here).As far as the story goes, it's pretty standard straightforward stuff really, and it almost feels like this film could have been created by any director.Honestly, if someone showed me a large chunk of this film for the first time without those handful of distinct Hitchcock camera work scenes and asked me who directed it I don't think I would know (even after revisiting a lot of his catalog recently).

",10,"One of Hitchcock's great masterpieces, and the best of his films with Ingrid Bergman. A disturbing love story perfectly framed in a story of suspense and espionage.The entire beginning of the film may seem somewhat rushed, until the arrival in Rio, and of course it is difficult for us to understand today so much concern for the joyful life of the protagonist, for the fact of seeing her hanging out and getting drunk with her friends. We have to put on the glasses of the 40s.We have Ingrid Bergman as the daughter of a Nazi emigrated to the US and convicted of treason. His daughter, from the moment she discovered what her father was and rejecting him, has dedicated herself to a ""dissolute life"", she is a woman doubly marked, as the daughter of a traitor to the country and as an alcoholic and apparently a woman of many many men.This first scene where Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant appear is magnificent, although we don't find Ingrid's drunkenness entirely credible (one of those perfectly aesthetic drunkennesses where the actress is not allowed to lose an iota of her beauty). Cary Grant is a dark and impassive presence, as he will be throughout the film, watching the girl from a distance. He can be certainly disturbing when he gives her a punch. When Cary Grant offers her to work as a spy for American intelligence, Ingrid Bergman's reaction can be hard to understand: the initial blunt refusal changes in a second when the rich old man comes to pick her up for a luxurious boat trip. Naturally, Ingrid, at that moment, has clearly seen the two options in her life: and being the toy of an elite of rich and libidinous elite does not seem to be the best of the two.So, turned she into a spy, they travel to Rio, awaiting information about their mission. And for eight days, Bergman falls in love with Cary Grant, and a third option seems to emerge in her life, but this option, of course, also depends on Cary Grant.And Cary Grant doesn't seem to be up for the task: distant and somewhat contemptuous of the ""stained"" past of the protagonist, he feels attracted to her, probably falling in love too, but clearly on the defensive: after all, a girl with a past who is the daughter of a traitor is not just a good game. It may be the very least to demand proof that she has changed, a heroic rejection of her past and everything like it. It may almost be better not to get those proofs, and have an excuse not to fall in love. We begin to think that for Grant Ingrid Bergman is a dangerous threat.Hitchcock never shows it more clearly than in the wonderful kissing scene on the hotel terrace. Bergman was never more passionate, sensual and seductive, without getting Grant to abandon a recalcitrant and detached attitude. The camera follows them in a closeness of the most absolute indiscretion, it is almost becoming somewhat embarrassing (and delighting) for us to attend such intimacy. Anyway the call from Grant's boss to meet him in his office and explain what Ingrid's job will consist of seems almost a relief for him.The job turns out to be a mission a la Mata-Hari, and also with a possible old boyfriend of Ingrid's. Enough, Grant thinks, for a converted and sanctified Ingrid to have to unceremoniously reject the job and provide him with the proof he needed. But Ingrid can't take that initiative... without that third option in her life she was talking about showing itself minimally viable, because without Grant and without working as a spy, she's left with drunken binges with the rich. And of course...that third option was up to Grant...who takes a more inscrutable stance than ever. Grant shows his love and respect for her when he talks to his bosses aside, while for her he only has cold and hurtful phrases. It almost seems that Grant is hoping that Ingrid will accept the job of seducing another man, and that way, being able to despise her, she will become a harmless woman.The moments of greatest tension take place at the party of the new and unlikely Sebastian marriage. There are shots as surprising as the beginning of the scene in which the camera initially shows the guests enjoying themselves elegantly at the party, but which becomes more tense as it approaches the object of our concerns: a key hidden in Bergman's hand.It is especially from here that Grant's character becomes more and more unjustifiable, not hesitating in the slightest to put the woman he is in love with in serious trouble in order to get information from the investigation they are carrying out. It would be unbelievable that after the scene at the cellar Bergman would not be discovered, but even so Grant abandons her to her fate without regard. Does it seem so unlikely to him that they will take drastic measures against her? Does it matter so little? At this point it may seem to us that Grant's bitterness and unwarranted rancor has turned into cruelty and sadism.Both Grant and Bergman are terrific. Among the supporting cast, Claude Rains gives enormous relief and sympathy to the character of the villain and especially jealous husband, but the one that is truly unforgettable is Leopoldine Konstantine as his jealous and dangerous mother. When Ingrid is welcomed into her home for the first time, we see her mother descend the stairs from a distance, with a face that we barely make out, but in which we guess a deeply sinister character. As she gets closer, the distrust and resentment she harbors towards the woman with whom his son is in love becomes more and more evident, until for a moment she enters the shadows, and although we are almost sure that she has not changed the expression on her face, when she comes to light again, appears to us as a polite old woman anxious to be pleasant to what may be her future daughter-in-law (in a certain way it is conceptually an inverse shot of the famous tracking shot of the party that is increasingly tense as it approaches the foreground of the key).The romantic music is by Roy Webb, although for the soundtrack of the more suspenseful scene, Hitchcock opts for the Brazilian music that the band plays at the party. Bergman is especially beautiful in this film especially when her hair is let down, and of course her wardrove is by Edith Head.The script, signed by Ben Hecht but in which, as always, Hitchcock was the determining factor, manages to give coherence to all this hodgepodge of emotions and builds around them a story of suspense and mystery using a series of recurring visual elements: bottles of wine, keys, cups of tea, and of course a majestic staircase. But as always with Hitchcock, it's his purely visual storytelling that makes the difference. Many scenes are true masterclasses in cinematic storytelling, the more interesting the less dialogue they have.In short, a masterpiece by the author, among his five or six best films.",4 July 2023

I wanted to see the sneaking element of it and how they achieved what they set out to do, how they discovered their information, but it was more about Devlin's (Cary Grant) jealousy towards Alicia (Ingrid Bergman) instead, added to a lack of trust which caused even more problems.It didn't have to be like 'James Bond' with gadgets and fast cars, but it just needed that something else to be interesting about it, because the romance was of such a basic formula that it could have been written by anyone and wasn't enough on its own.The leading pair fell in love so quickly, as they tended to do in films of that era, but they were also far too over the top with it and so fakely passionate that it was hard to watch at times. I felt like a cringing teenager watching his Dad kissing his Mum and groaning about it, but it was a lot and very theatrical.Claude Rains, who played the role of Alex, has been really growing on me though. Having seen him in quite a few films lately, it has been easy to see why he got so much work in his time. I really appreciate his clear diction apart from anything else.Cary was his usual self and I suppose that Ingrid Bergman was good too, but nobody really delivered anything outstanding by my standards.Overall, it wasn't the best Hitchcock, the best spy film or film in general for me personally, but it wasn't so bad that I wanted to turn it off.

Hitchcock mixes sentimental romance with fairly reverberant political spy drama in the wake of WWII - a Casablanca with Hitchcock's stamp of paranoia and angst, if you like. The film's power lies in the obscure and implicit. Nobody ever says or does what they really want; they are inhibited by their own reserve and the implications of a world war. When Bergman realizes the danger she's in towards the end, Hitchcock flaunts his visual skills to tighten the grip on her and us. The film's final fifteen minutes are so tense that you may forgive whatever sullen melodrama you've been subjected to along the way.

",5,"The famous part about Notorious was the kiss scene. Back in the day of the Production Code, it was against the rules to have a kiss last longer than three seconds, so in order to get around that, Alfred Hitchcock told his actors Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman to keep interspersing bits of dialogue in the breaks of their kisses. They talk, they kiss, they talk again, they kiss again. However, if you're a connoisseur of old movies, you know that several movies broke the three-second-rule before Notorious did. Much like Gone With the Wind's hype, it was just publicity rather than fact. If you want to see a movie that really broke the kiss code, rent Fallen Angel and ask, ""Cary who?""
If anyone cares about the plot, it would be best to read about it beforehand. As usual, this Hitchcock drama is very slow-going and quite boring; I had to watch it twice to stay awake long enough to actually understand the story. In any case, Ingrid Bergman gets asked to be a spy by secret agent Cary Grant. Her father was an evil Nazi, and her assignment is to pretend she's following in his footsteps with his old cronies - then report all her findings back to Cary and the government. Claude Rains is the head bad guy, in a different role from Casablanca, but believable as a wealthy, slimy, power-hungry villain nonetheless.Notorious isn't my favorite Hitchcock, so I wouldn't really recommend it unless you love his slow style.

The film features some nice scenery and locations, the costumes also looked fine too. Oddly enough my favourite scene is probably the one involving the bicycle ride, the bike representing progress, soon to replace the horse, as civilisation overtakes anarchy and lawlessness. The film is set in 1899 after the old western frontier has closed, two outlaws still carry out robberies but there days are numbered and there's no wilderness left now to escape into really. The two are hunted relentlessly and one of my favourite parts is them trekking up a high ridge to try and escape, it looks great, they're completely breathless as they climb and there's no going back. The duo then move on to Bolivia to continue their robberies, why it's okay to rob from such a poor country of course doesn't enter their heads.

",9,"This is more of a ""buddy"" movie than it is a ""western"". It needs to be appreciated as a movie, without trying to fit it into the limits of the ""western"" genre. It is more like Easy Rider, it is all about the two main characters and their pursuit. It is a metaphor for the end of the ""wild west"". The chase scene is deliberately long, to make that point. It is not the posse that is chasing them, it is the taming of the west itself, as said in the dialogue by Sheriff Bledsoe ""You're nothing but two bit outlaws on the dodge, it's over, don't you get that? Your times is over, and you're gonna die bloodied, all you can do is choose where.""
When this movie came out i had no interest is seeing another ""western"", they had been done to death on the silver screen and particularly on 1950's and 1960's television series. I heard so much about this movie, that years later when i finally saw it, i understood all the fuss that it generated. The screen writers took a worn out genre, put in modern dialogue, avoided the chiches, cast three of the biggest stars of the time, and created a masterpiece from the ashes of the burned out ""westerns"".One of the most brilliantly subtle scenes ever was the discussion of whether Ettta Place (the gorgeous Katherine Ross) would go with them to Bolivia. Her quote ""I'm 26 and i'm single, and a school teacher and that's the bottom of the pit, and the only excitement i've known is here with me now, so i'll go with you and i won't whine, and i'll sew your socks and i'll stitch you when you're wounded, and i'll do anything you ask of me, except one thing, I won't watch you die, i'll miss that scene if you don't mind."" That dialogue, earlier in the film, set up the famous ending, when she said ""I might go back ahead of you, I was thinking of it, maybe i'll go, I'll go then."" The character was speaking to us, the audience. Brilliant writing!This is not a fast all-action movie like the Fast and Furious films, it is a well written experience that gives us time to fall in love with the characters, as neither they nor we can escape from the inevitable.

",8,"In general, the musical is a genre of a slightly different style in cinema. It doesn't look like fantasy, horror, or comedy. Something mysterious is hidden in it, which carries a very fragrant message. In the 80s, when rock and roll dominated the music industry, it is logical to say that the British rock band Pink Floyd had an important place in pop culture during that time. Anyone reading this article may be a more experienced listener than me, may be more competent in this field, but no one can convince me that there is a band or singer who has written better music than Pink Floyd. My favorite band is the killers, but I admit that Pink Floyd is in a different category. The group, which was formed in 1965, went through many obstacles during its existence. For example, in the 60s, the founder of the group, Syd Barrett, was diagnosed with a mental disorder and left the band soon after. In such a difficult situation, Roger Waters took the responsibility of guiding the concept of the band. Until 1985, Waters was the group's leader and main driving force. But in 1985, the guitarist left the band and said that the era of Pink Floyd was over. Today, when we talk about this legendary musical kingdom, we always mention the political context, because David Gilmour and Roger Waters both carry radically different political tastes. Gilmore supports Ukraine, while Waters calls the war with Russia pointless. In 1982, no less famous English director Alan Parker shot the film Pink Floyd - The Wall. This film is a film adaptation of Pink Floyd's most popular album Wall. One film critic said that this film is Pink Floyd's longest music video. Bob Geldof, who plays the main role in Pink, is not a member of this band, but he very convincingly played the role of a young person alienated from society.In my opinion, the title of the film and the album accurately reflects the philosophy of the band.

Today, there is some consensus in considering it one of the best rock albums ever and ""Another Brick in the Wall"" has become an anthem for teenage rebellion, which does not conform to the rules, dictates and conventions. And I feel free to say all this because rock is not, by any stretch of the imagination, one of my personal preference styles of music. I listen, casually, but I wouldn't pay for a ticket.What this film does, essentially, is to take the concept of the album - which was designed and released as if it were a kind of opera-rock - and give it a look to match in an absolutely dreamlike, hallucinated style. There is no plot other than the one that goes on in the head of the protagonist, the rock vocalist Pink, who seems to be experiencing a very deep depression, as his social and emotional isolation increases, caused by an absent father (he died in the war when he was a child), an overprotective mother, a series of abusive teachers and a recent divorce.Watching the film is like watching a musical nightmare. It's not an optimistic film, and it's not easy to watch, especially because the plot isn't very obvious and there are no explanations. There are several impactful scenes, so I don't know if it's the most suitable film for impressionable audiences. There are many fantasies about war, about power and using power to control others. There are also some good animated scenes, although they are just as disturbing as all the others. However, the film is just that... and Pink Floyd's music.

",9,"""The Wall"" is a 1982 musical drama film based on Pink Floyd's 1979 rock opera album of the same name. The film follows the story of a rock star named Pink, played by Bob Geldof, who is struggling with the emotional trauma of his past. Through a series of hallucinatory and surreal experiences, Pink confronts his feelings of abandonment, isolation, and self-destructive behavior. The story is told through a series of animated and live-action sequences, with Pink gradually building a metaphorical ""wall"" around himself as he becomes increasingly alienated from society. The wall represents his emotional defenses, which he uses to protect himself from the pain and trauma of his past.The Wall is a highly visual film that follows a young man who lost his father is what appears to be World War 1. There are many undertones to death and chaos through out the film that are associated to this young mans life without a father. Some of the editing techniques and transitions are very interesting as they move from real life to cartoons. There is one scene in particular that shows a bird flying through the air, but it transitions to cartoon, and the bird is killed by a big-black robotic looking bird of prey. These transitions in editing are used throughout the entire film.The lighting in ""The Wall"" is typical very dark, in order to support the transition of Pink building a metaphorical wall around himself.""The Wall"" is not like any other musical film that I have ever seen. ""Into the Never"" by Metallica is close in that it depicts a man transitioning as he helps the band, but it is mainly focused on an actual concert rather than a central theme.""The Wall"" by Pink Floyd is an absolute masterpiece!

I found Coleen Gray's portrayal of Fay to be the most impressive. In one scene she has to filter through several contrasting emotions as the dialogue progresses and she did so in such a natural way.The most entertaining parts of the movie for me are the bar-fight with the hairy, Georgian thug employed to distract the police and, of course, the protracted ending where everything goes tits up.

",8,"""The killing"" (1956) is the first real serious production of Stanley Kubrick. It is a film noir.The general opinion is that Kubrick, in this phase of his career, was a follower of genre conventions and not yet an innovator. The film is praised above all for its craftsmanship.One element that in my opinion is nevertheles innovative is the way the story (a heist on a horserace track) is told. The story is not told in chronological order but seen from the perspective of the different members of the heist-team. This means that each episode from the story is told sevaral times, but each time seen from a different perspective. Images from the horses walking to their starting position indicates that there has been a change in perspective.This way of telling a story is also used in ""Satantango"" (1994, Bela Tarr), but with a running time of 7h, 19m Tarr had all the time in the World to tell a (minimalist) story from different perspectives. In other reviews I read that Quentin Tarantino borrowed this way of telling a story from Kubrick and used it in ""Reservoir dogs"" (1992) and ""Pulp fiction"" (1994).In the instance of ""The killing"" the way the story is told has a close connection with the story itself. The story is told from the perspective of the individual teammembers, but these teammembers are informed by the mastermind of the heist (Johnny Clay played by Sterling Hayden) on a strictly need to know basis. One member is told to start a quarrel at the bar just to distract the attention, and this is all he knew. One can't help to wonders if the way Johnny Clay manages the members of his heist team is not a bit like the way Stanley Kubrick manages his actors in his future films.Of course even a perfect planning (the voice over keeps giving detailed time indications) is no match for the whims of fate. At the end of the film the whims af fate appear in the form of a little dog.

The guys have a plan and it all comes together until.. bang!I enjoyed all the characters. It's not just a bunch of grumpy old men with no personalities who just act like cool criminals.

",7,"....take a train?I'm going through all the Kubrick's in chronological order. The previous Killer's Kiss (6/10) was a watchable but middling noir romp with a couple of strong scenes and interesting camera work.The Killing is of very similar ilk but feels like a slight upgrade: script & plot is more ambitious, camera a little more dynamic and there's a bigger cast to work with.Non-linear structure works well, you can see where Tarantino got some influence from. Acting is mostly good except for action scenes where it feels quite theatrical (typical 50's movie). The biggest weakness of the movie is that the tidy robbery plan of the script is at odds with some of the leaps of logic the viewer is asked to make: firstly there's that one absurd shootout where the door is just opened without caution, and everyone dies despite not nearly enough shooting happening. Still, this scene is just about acceptable.The 'script-killer' is the reasoning of Johnny to take a plane instead of a train or even car. This decision is inconsistent with how the movie has sold us on the logistical planning-ahead capabilities of the brains behind the plan. Going on a plane-flight with a large suitcase full of cash is clearly a dodgy idea: logically the suitcase won't typically be allowed on board and would have to be checked in. It doesn't seem correct that Johnny didn't think of this, even taking into account the unexpected event where he had to take all the cash (as the narrator told us, even this potential event was prepared for).This incompetence of the otherwise calculating Johnny Clay slightly dampens the impact of the ending when he realises the game is up (well-acted, tho').Still, while these criticisms prevent a higher score they didn't stop me enjoying the movie: it was entertaining, interesting and nicely filmed. The many characters are well-drawn, despite their short screentimes.Kubrick famously then left the noir-crime genre to go in all kinds of different directions. The next - Paths of Glory - may thematically resemble his very first work Fear and Desire, but undoubtedly will show a significantly-improved production.",28 June 2023

",6,"A pretty good film. I bought this on Blu-ray and it has a 4:3 aspect ratio and black and white cinematography. The music and cinematography are nicely done, it's a good looking film but at times a little bit televisual, lots of indoor scenes anyway. You don't really get to see the great big west. There's a bit more to this film, it's not just Clint Eastwood blasting away the baddies while looking amazing cool. The film stars Grace Kelly and Garry Cooper who both give good performances but aren't convincing really as a newly married couple. Our main character has a choice to flee or fight when he hears an old enemy is coming back into town to gun him down. Our hero spends most of the film trying to raise some help but everywhere he turns people have an excuse not to help. Most of the drama happens within this section of the film but the characters we meet we never see again while we just get shot after shot of the villains at the train station doing not much given it's the days before smartphones. The townsfolk are portrayed as unrealistically cowardly perhaps though if I was in there shoes I who knows how I'd behave, our main character is really not having the best of days. The film has some memorable shots including a crane shot of the town deserted as our hero is left to his fate. I didn't buy the ending though. The Villain is also unseen for most of the film, which does build up our anticipation but he's also not very memorable or interesting when he finally does arrive. The film does some good things though in making an interesting story about a man left alone in a lonely place while struggling to do the right thing.",24 December 2023

rw9031088,ur19180472,tt0044706," The tension mounts as the noon train approaches
",10,"1952's ""High Noon"" received seven Oscar nominations (winning four), its box office take more than making up for numerous critics like John Wayne, whose dislike was shared by director Howard Hawks (their response was 1959's ""Rio Bravo""). Gary Cooper's Best Actor victory as Marshal Will Kane revived a slumping career, while newcomer Grace Kelly earned the notice of director Alfred Hitchcock despite his belief that her portrayal of a Quaker wife was 'too mousy.' Will Kane's tenure as lawman in the New Mexico town of Hadleyville is coming to an end, his wedding to Kelly's Amy putting him on the path to blissful retirement as a storekeeper, only to be rudely interrupted by calamitous news that notorious outlaw Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) has been pardoned and will arrive for his revenge on the noon train, where brother Ben (Sheb Wooley) awaits with accomplices Colby (Lee Van Cleef) and Pierce (Robert J. Wilke). It's been five years since Kane put Miller away, and the Hadleyville residents haven't forgotten how good things were before he got caught, and all attempts by the marshal to seek deputies fall upon deaf ears. The mayor (Thomas Mitchell), the hotheaded deputy (Lloyd Bridges), the retired marshal that Kane idolizes (Lon Chaney), even the judge who sentenced Miller (Otto Kruger), all prove reluctant to put their community in greater danger, and while some voice support for the way Kane has done his job there's no one to help him. Amy became a pacifist Quaker after seeing her father and brother killed by guns, choosing to depart rather than stand by her man, an opinion not shared by her husband's former lover (Katy Jurado), who will also be leaving on the same train. The tension ratchets up as the clock on the wall ticks away every moment as the film progresses in natural time, an astonishing feat that earned editing Oscars for Elmo Williams and Harry W. Erstad. Of all the supporting performers, it is Lon Chaney who best sums up how it feels to be a lawman in the Old West 'for a tin star' (the original novel's title was ""The Tin Star""), original choice Victor McLaglen busy on location in Ireland shooting John Ford's ""The Quiet Man."" Despite being five years younger than Gary Cooper, Chaney's voice was what really impressed producer Stanley Kramer, conveying the bitter disillusionment of doing the right thing for a town full of ingrates, now too old and feeble with busted knuckles and arthritis to be any help to his successor. He would reunite with Cooper for his next Western, the color ""Springfield Rifle,"" while Kramer would call upon Chaney again for both ""Not As a Stranger"" and ""The Defiant Ones.""",3 May 2023

",6,"High Noon (1) (1952) -That was probably the best acting I've ever seen from Gary Cooper, who played Marshall Will Kane, but I was expecting Lloyd Bridges (Deputy Harvey Pell) to make jokes all the way through this film. It was unusual to see him playing things straight, having mostly seen him in the 'Airplane' (1980) and 'Hot Shots' (1993) films.I would say that I've definitely seen worse westerns than this one and often they've starred Gary Cooper, so this was a nice surprise. It was easy to watch and flowed well, I could feel the tension building in the town as the events progressed and the expected train got closer.I also felt that it had similarities to 'Young Guns' (1988) in the way that it was a fuller story that considered character backstories and emotions and it didn't rush things at all.Although it was odd how they obviously sped the shots up at the end, probably trying to bring the film in at a certain length.They also really got the most out of the soundtrack, 'High Noon (Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darling)' which was very nearly overplayed.If I had been Marshall Kane though, I would have gone after Helen Ramirez (Katy Jurado), because she had far more character than Grace Kelly's, Amy Fowler Kane, who actually just got annoying the more the film went on.I had hoped for a slightly happier ending, the typical thing that might have been expected, with the whole town coming out to support the Marshall, but I wasn't disappointed with what I got.Okay, so I won't be buying it on DVD, but it really wasn't a bad film at all for a boring afternoon.611.88/1000.",25 March 2023

rw8923457,ur160914527,tt0044706," It's Miller time.
",10,"Few motion pictures, whether they be a Western or another genre, are as allegorical as this one. Scripted by the soon-to-be blacklisted Carl Foreman, HIGH NOON was intended as a subtle polemic against the anti-communist witch hunts then plaguing the film capital and the rest of America. It was made by independent producer Stanley Kramer, a liberal best known for the social commentary in his movies.HIGH NOON's parable about hysteria and betrayal was not lost on some of Hollywood's most rabid hawks such as John Wayne, who actually decried this classic Western as un-American and unpatriotic. Even apolitical types like director Howard Hawks chimed in, saying it was tantamount to heresy that any movie lawman would consider backing down from a fight.Curiously, none of that vitriol was aimed towards its star Gary Cooper. Long known in the industry as a Republican, Cooper was described by former lover Patricia Neal as ""conservative but not necessarily right-wing"". Translated, that meant he drew the line when it veered into reactionary territory.Going against the grain of his fellow Hollywood conservatives, Cooper remained supportive of Foreman, even after the latter's blacklist, and continued to be until the actor's death from cancer in 1961. In hindsight, those qualities made him perfect for the role of Will Kane.HIGH NOON was directed by Fred Zinnemann who, at that time was under a three picture contract to Kramer. Being an Austrian of the Jewish faith, Zinnemann seemed as likely a director of Westerns as Billy Wilder and Ernst Lubitsch. But as a boy, he read with fascination a series of Westerns written by Karl May, a fellow Austrian who had never set foot in the American West (!). After Kramer acquired the rights to Foreman's property, Zinnemann was excited about finally having the opportunity to direct an American Western.HIGH NOON's plot is a fairly straightforward one. Marshal Will Kane is about to retire as soon as he marries his young Quaker bride Amy (Grace Kelly). The small ceremony takes place in the justice of the peace's office with a few friends in attendance, and as soon as the nuptials are completed, Kane receives a telegram. Frank Miller, an old enemy whom Kane arrested for murder, has just been pardoned from prison instead of hanging for his crime.There's even more ominous news. Three of Miller's cronies, one of whom is his brother, arrive in town and park themselves at the depot in anticipation of the noon train. Their presence has everyone in a tizzy because it's obvious that Miller is returning to exact revenge upon the man who sent him up the river: Will Kane.Fearing a bloodbath when Miller returns, the town's leading citizens urge Will to leave town at once with his new wife. But because his replacement is not expected for another twenty-four hours, Kane feels duty bound to remain until relieved by his successor, upsetting just about everyone: mainly Amy and his deputy Harvey Pell (Lloyd Bridges).In the hopes of discouraging Miller and his trio ~plus the friends in town looking forward to his return~ Kane attempts to swear in a special posse, and that's when he learns the true meaning of loyalty. None of Will's ""friends"" are willing to help him out in his hour of need. Sore at not being entrusted with replacing Kane in the marshal's job, Pell sulks like a child and quits on him. As for Amy, her pacifist beliefs compel her to plead with her husband to walk away from the danger. When he refuses to back down, she announces her intention to leave on the noon train rather than remain and watch him die.Dreading Miller's wrath, the judge who sentenced him to death decides to get out while the getting's good. Will's old lawman mentor is too crippled by arthritis to be of any assistance to him, and therefore declines his request. As for everyone else, they're just plain scared. The only ones who are willing to strap on a gun are a naive teenage boy and an alcoholic, unsteady ex-colleague of Kane's, neither of whom will be effective in helping him face off against the bad guys.HIGH NOON quietly broke a few stereotypical Western barriers. One is the character of Helen Ramirez (played by Katy Jurado), the saloon proprietress. Back then, it was very uncommon to see a Hispanic female in a Western who's also a successful businesswoman in a predominantly white town. It was just as atypical to see a señorita portrayed as indomitable without being labeled with such racial euphemisms as ""spitfire"".HIGH NOON also deviated from the outdoors epics that Westerns had become by 1952. More than half of the story takes place indoors as Kane tries in vain to recruit a posse. When Zinnemann and his cinematographer Floyd Crosby (David's dad) show us the exterior, there's no wide open skies with beautiful vistas and occasional cloud formations; just a stark, grey stratosphere ~probably caused by Los Angeles' smog~ that astutely captures HIGH NOON's mood of dread.The most unique feature of HIGH NOON is that the story plays out in real time, the exact number of minutes, thanks to Zinnemann's brilliant direction. He and editor Elmo Williams should be commended for no wasted throwaway scenes, keeping the narrative tightly focused while also keeping the characterizations in check. Other clever touches include (a) the endless shots of the railroad tracks stretching into the horizon, personifying the foreboding in the air, and (b) the swinging pendulum inside the grandfather clock in Kane's office illustrating that time is running out for the beleaguered marshal.HIGH NOON was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won four: Dmitri Tiomkin took home two for his score and the song ""Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling""; Elmo Williams' superb editing; and Gary Cooper's second win for Best Actor. The remaining three
~ screenplay, direction, and film~ were deserving to have taken the gold too, but were forsaken ~pun intended. Of all the movies Cooper made in his career, HIGH NOON was the one he was the most proud of. Watch it and you will see why. 🔚",12 March 2023

Though I've watched numerous detailed analytics videos about the Tornatore Trilogy, the Legend of 1900 still resonated with me on a personal level. Unlike Forrest Gump who symbolizes the America's post-war right-wing spirit, 1900, disregarding his talent, comprises the qualities most of us may have in reality: introvert, timid, unsociable, and often introspective. He's blunt enough to irritate the captain and outplay the greatest jazz musician, but not brave enough to profess his love or step off a stairs; he could perform melodies with pure emotions and imaginations, but couldn't discern the voice of the ocean. Tim Roth portrayed such character with great depth, as I see myself in the eyes of 1900. Moreover, the movie narrates the grand yet exquisite tale with ravishing cinematography and designs, appealing minor plots, and fantastic score by Ennio Morricone. One point I disagree upon is 1900's confession in the end, as he claims that the endless life is what can be worrisome: indeed, appreciating what's already owned and present is crucial, but life is also meaningful for it involves constant learning and adventures.

through the first ep and as well as with the ending preview but damn the emotional outbursts and melodrama in the movie was weirdly not as effective as it was when I watched the 2nd season.It offered more and somehow made me feel bad for the characters very early offing.The third act/the last two ep's even though if it was the best part of the movie/series was also a bit of an odd one coz of it's initiation being done through a puzzling arrival of Akaza(it's understandable but still very awkward) who also battled with the Hashira like he always had known him coz of battle experience with him earlier on or something.I know this maybe that little something that's gonna be later explained with focus on the Akaza or maybe more in the backstory of Rengoku or maybe not but still I hate in when anime does these.Anyways the movie had attractive animation, definitely ubercool fight sequences and scores but beyond that it's not something that's a gem of a movie especially when considering that this is the highest earning Japanese flick liveaction or anime of all time.That's a hell of a title and to see that's it held by this movie just feels not really deserving.Ps Why is Tanjiro such a pure human being it's kinda annoying tbh lol.",29 July 2023

The rest of the movie still had me prepared to give a 9/10 or 10/10 review, but the ending really sealed the deal. I did everything I could to avoid spoilers, even closing my eyes when the opening credit scene showed. Because of that, my jaw hit the floor when Akaza showed up. It was a final boss music moment for sure. Watching Rengoku, who admittedly is now my favorite character, fight a futile battle left me breathless. As the fight wore on, it was clear that he could not win, and yet even though I knew what was coming, the movie managed to take my breath away. Starting with his proclamation that he will see his duty fufilled, the next 15 minutes are utter perfection. The swelling of the music as Rengoku says, ""set your heart ablaze"", the beautiful fire that spreads through his body, clashing with Akaza's theme. The score is on point, and as soon as Rengoku unleashes his final attack, the moment becomes a spiritual experience. The animators flex every last ounce of their skill, and the score with the ominous chants is perfect. Rengoku's refusal to et up and the flashbacks that he goes through only add to the dramatic weight. His dying words though are why I wrote this review. They were simple yet profound. The idea that one can simply ""set their heart ablaze"", when they feel that they are not enough is a lesson every person should hear.

",8,"First film of the dollar trilogy by the great Sergio Leone, a director who died too soon and was unfortunately forgotten by many. The film is set in a small town on the border with Mexico, San Miguel, dominated by two rival families (the Baxters and the Rojos), where an American gunslinger called Joe, played by Clint Eastwood, arrives. His only interest is to earn a few dollars; in order to get them, he is willing to help both families of criminals, but is involuntarily involved in a conflict between the two sides. Eastwood's choice was one of Leone's most apt choices. In an interview, he said he chose him because he saw him on an American show and noticed that he was slow, silent and always had a rather apathetic face. So Leone took his cue to create a character destined to become one of the most iconic in film history. Mention must be made of Gian Maria Volontè's great performance as Ramòn Rojo, who, in the finale, gives us one of the most beautiful scenes of the trilogy. It is impossible not to mention the late Ennio Morricone, author of wonderful soundtracks, who was no less impressive in this film. To understand the greatness of the film, it is enough to know that it was made with 90 million Italian lire, corresponding to about 52,000 dollars, which was already very little at the time, let alone today. Certainly this had a negative effect on the film, especially on the set design, which was a little sparse, but one has only to bow before a man who with such a small budget managed to pull off a great film that was destined to revolutionise the western genre. Suffice it to say that after the film's success, Americans abandoned Arizona, Texas and Colorado, where American westerns were set, to go and film in Spain, where Leone had shot his first western. It is not the best of the trilogy, but perhaps of the three it is the one that has had the greatest impact on film history.8.5.",1 January 2024

One thing you notice right away is the dubbing is really bad, even for Eastwood, it just doesn't match well what you're seeing on the screen. Eastwood plays a young, tall, handsome gunslinger and solider of fortune way down south on the American Mexico border who gets caught up in a dispute between two families that he might be able to exploit to his advantage. It's a film that is quite grainy and you can see the low budget feel to it but it gives it a nice rough look, not too polished which is actually nice in this case. The production design, costumes and landscapes all look really good in this too, there's very little primary colour, everything is sort of faded and worn and a bit desaturated. The Eastwood character talks a bit more in this first film, he starts off a pretty awesome and unrelenting character who calmly observes every situation and has no problem with blasting away some bullies. The film has some interesting camera angles and the cinematography is very memorable. I'd say the music is nice, rather than epic though. We get the famous close ups, sometimes just characters eyes, it's that intense. Eastwood's character though is not superman in this film, he does have vulnerabilities and he gets badly beaten and abused which of course only leads to him becoming this avenging angel at the end.

",8,"Tough New York detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) is investigating the murder of advertising executive Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney). Laura is loved by men and admired or envied by women, and it is up to McPherson to sift through her relationships to try to piece together the puzzle. As he investigates her private affairs through witness testimony and private documents, he finds himself falling in love with the idea and essence of Laura. When a surprise visitor arrives at Laura's apartment a few days into the investigation, the case is turned on its head and the plot thickens.There is no denying the film's glossy production values. Excellent camera-work moves smoothly through gorgeous sets, snappy dialogue is present throughout, and it is generally timed and directed with precision. The film won the Oscar in 1945 for cinematography, beating Wilder's superbly shot Double Indemnity, and it also picked up nominations for ""best supporting actor"", ""best screenplay"" and the archaic and oddly specific ""best art direction- interior decoration, Black-and-White"". Preminger also received a nomination for Best Director alongside Hitchcock and Wilder (Leo McCarey ultimately took the statue home in one of many errors in judgment by the Academy). On a technical level Laura cannot be criticised by anyone but the most pedantic of viewers.The screenplay is the main thrust of a film of this type though, and although it generally delivers, it also hits a couple of bum notes. Detective McPherson is essentially an extension to the audience in the first half of the film, and he speaks to characters the viewers want to speak to, and asks the questions they want asked. The plot is teasingly unveiled, with just enough information to keep you guessing, and little enough to preseve the mystery. Just when you think you are figuring something out, another twist sheds a whole new light on things. Unfortunately though, it's a bit too clever for it's own good, and takes a few liberties to recover - ones which are deal-breakers in my opinion. I do not want to spoil the plot too much for anyone that hasn't seen this yet, but I baulked when McPherson - completely unprompted and without motive - knew exactly where the obscurely hidden murder weapon was. It was as if he had suddenly developed x-ray vision. Hints were subliminally suggested to the audience earlier in the film, but there really was no way the detective could have known about it.There were a couple of other issues that I cannot really discuss in great detail without spoilers - for example an emotional level to a relationship that seems to develop in a blink of an eye. I can't say any more, but there are other flaws if you are keeping a close eye on the plot developments. I am all for a little suspension of disbelief in movies, but for a film that requires such concentration on the character and plot developments, sloppy plot-holes and a moment of Deus ex Machina should not have existed, and this left a nasty taste in my mouth.The two main stars of the film, Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews put in great performances, especially Andrews as the shrewd detective. The same cannot be said for supporting actor Vincent Price. It probably doesn't help that his character is a bumbling idiot, but Price delivers the lines in a very stagey, slightly awkward way and was a bit of an ambience breaker.

",9,"Many consider the final installment in the Dollars trilogy (Good, Bad, Ugly) the best, and there is an argument to be made on its behalf, but the first one is my personal favorite. The more popular Sergio Leone got, the more fat he added to the mix. After the Dollars trilogy, his movies became more and more bloated and, in my opinion, not much fun to rewatch. Fistful of Dollars shows what a good spaghetti western should be--quick run time, relentless gun play, indifferent protagonist, and wicked villains. The story is familiar--Dashiell Hammett's Red Harvest (first adapted in Japan as Yojimbo). It doesn't get bogged down in the politics later spaghetti westerns did. And the music, well, it's Morricone, what do you expect? The little flourishes on the soundtrack to accompany certain moments are so perfect you'd think you were witnessing pure cinematic poetry.

",7,"During the sixties the Western was in decline in America. In the same decade the Spaghetti Western was on the rise in Europe, with Sergio Leone as the most prominent director.""A fistfull of dollars"" (1964) is the first film of his ""Dollars"" or ""The man with no name"" trilogy. The other two films are ""For a few dollars more"" (1965) and ""The good, the bad and the ugly"" (1966).In general ""The good, the bad and the ugly"" is seen as the best film of this trilogy, but in ""A fistfull of dollars"" we can see the characteristics of the Spaghetti Western for the first time. The story was based on the Kurosawa film ""Yojimbo"" (1961).What are these characteristics of the Spaghetti Western? There is the music of Ennio Morricone and Clint Eastwood is playing the man with no name in a phlegmatic manner (copied from Yojimbo?) with his poncho and his cigar. There are also the locations in Spain (chosen for their likeness with Mexico) in stead of Monument valley in the John Ford Westerns. But what is the contribution of Sergio Leone to all this?In the first place the lead character with no name is a loner but he certainly is not the typical good guy. When he arrives in town (in a memorable scene where the first oncoming traffic turns out to be a corps on a horse) his intention is to make money by playing of the rival clans against each other. Only the hostage Marisol (Marianne Koch) awakens his sympathy and makes him a good guy later in the movie.Leone also adds a comic relief (commedia dell arte?) in the form of the coffin maker Piripero (Joseph Egger), who does excellent business in this film.Stylistically Leone adds opera elements to the Western. There is above average violence and he uses close ups very frequently. The second element may be inspired by early Russian cinema (for example Sergei Eisenstein).",6 August 2023

",10,"Based on writer/director Cameron Crowe's experiences as a teenage music journalist, ""Almost Famous"" is one of the best rock and roll films ever made. Patrick Fugit is William Miller, a budding writer who is sent on an article assignment by a Rolling Stone magazine editor who thinks he is much older. William meets up with the fictional band Stillwater, and immediately falls for one of the band's groupies (they call themselves ""band aids""), Penny Lane (Kate Hudson, who looks and sounds just like her mom Goldie Hawn). As the band tours, and does all the rock star decadence, Fugit's mother Elaine waits and worries back home. Frances McDormand is absolutely perfect as a mother who thinks she is very liberal and free thinking, but still worries for her child's welfare. The band eventually welcome William into their inner circle, and the conflict between lead singer Jeff (Jason Lee) and charismatic guitarist Russell (Billy Crudup). A running gag involves William's complete inability to get Russell to sit down to an interview. Philip Seymour Hoffman is also wonderful as the late great Lester Bangs, the rock critic who is now worshiped by critics everywhere (even though all he ever did, that was different from others, was be completely honest). Lester warns William never to befriend the band, something William cannot help. As the band makes its way across the country, William gets pressure from Rolling Stone, groupies, and his mother.I usually have no sympathy for musicians and celebrities who complain and give into the temptations and trappings of the road and too much money. Cameron Crowe does not excuse the bad behavior here, he shows how it is expected of the band. They are a rock band and must behave like animals, and party, and have groupies. Crowe makes the band so likable, and real, I could not help but keep watching them. The entire cast here is excellent. There is not one false line or stilted performance to be found. Fugit, for being a newcomer, is especially good. Crowe does a great job directing, not falling into the usual rock film trappings. The concert scenes give the viewer a sense of time, place, and music, and are short enough not to bore. Joe Hutshing and Saar Klein should have won Oscars for editing, keeping the pace flowing smoothly but never showing off. I think this film flopped at the box office because the studio did not know how to market it. Who wants to see another movie about how hard stardom is? Instead, this is a sweet, funny comedy. McDormand's telephone conversation with Crudup, and the plane scene where everyone confesses their deepest secrets, are two of the finest pieces of writing EVER, not just in the film.

Because Cameron Crowe didn't want to create any kind of hostility or resentment amongst the living, he decided it would be best if it was made as a story with made up characters.

",7,"Inside Out stands as a remarkable triumph in the realm of animated storytelling, skillfully weaving together a narrative that transcends age boundaries. Pixar, in collaboration with Disney, ventures into the depths of the human mind, crafting a vivid and emotionally resonant exploration of the complexities that shape our inner world.At the film's core are the anthropomorphized emotions: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger, each brought to life with vibrant personalities and distinct characteristics. This ingenious concept not only entertains but also serves as a metaphorical journey through the intricate landscape of our emotions. The personification of these feelings allows the audience to connect with the characters on a profound level, fostering empathy and understanding.Visually, it is a feast for the eyes. The animation is a testament to Pixar's mastery, with each frame meticulously crafted to capture the essence of the emotions and the fantastical world inside the mind. The vibrant hues of Joy's exuberance contrast with the subdued tones of Sadness, creating a visually stunning dichotomy that mirrors the ebb and flow of human emotions.What sets this film apart is its ability to tackle complex psychological concepts in a way that is accessible to audiences of all ages. The narrative gracefully navigates the challenges of growing up, addressing the inevitability of change and the importance of embracing the full spectrum of emotions. It serves as a valuable tool for both children and adults, fostering conversations about mental health and emotional well-being.At its emotional core, this one is a celebration of the necessity of sadness in the human experience. The film skillfully challenges the societal inclination to prioritize happiness over all other emotions, emphasizing that each feeling plays a crucial role in shaping our identities and experiences. This nuanced approach to emotional intelligence sets a new standard in animated storytelling, encouraging viewers to embrace and appreciate the intricacies of their own emotional landscapes.The voice cast, led by Amy Poehler as Joy and Phyllis Smith as Sadness, delivers stellar performances that breathe life into these animated embodiments of emotion. The chemistry among the cast members enhances the narrative, creating a dynamic ensemble that guides the audience through the highs and lows of the story.The movie is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of animation. Its rich tapestry of emotions, coupled with stunning animation and a thought-provoking narrative, elevates it to a status of enduring brilliance. A film that not only entertains but also enlightens, stands as a testament to the power of storytelling in fostering empathy, understanding, and appreciation for the beautifully complex human experience.",11 November 2023

There are so many things to comment about. For example, Humphrey Bogart. I knew Bogart was charismatic, his presence is undeniably magnetic. I didn't know though he is also a great actor. I was under the impression he plays the same character over and over (typecasting). I was wrong. He is a versatile actor. And he proves his versatility in this movie. It's not the first time he is menacing. But it's the first time he is enigmatic. And so mysterious.This is a great movie that keeps you guessing until the ending. It's not a typical crime drama/film noir, it's more like a psychological drama/thriller. Watch it without reading too much about the plot, you will enjoy it more like this .

A most unconventional date, explained by the fact that Bogie is a talented, but temperamental and tempestuous screenwriter in dire need of a HIT.

",8,"Humphrey Bogart gave us his great ""Psychopath Trilogy"" in the short space of only six years: The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948), In a Lonely Place (1950) and The Caine Mutiny (1954). The first (and probably the best known and most admired of the three films) involved Bogart's memorable creation Fred C. Dobbs. He was a decidedly paranoid and disturbed man with clearly defined anti-social tendencies, who also often talked to himself when agitated. The third (which presented perhaps the most pathetic and sympathetic of the three leading man roles) introduced us to the famous Captain Queeg----a middle aged veteran naval officer who had been in one too many battles, and as a result slowly became unhinged in the performance of his normal duties to the point that a sober but foolish subordinate officer instigated the title mutiny. But the second (and least known film in the trilogy) challenged Bogart to perform probably the most complex and difficult character of the three movies as screenwriter Dix Steele-----a man of considerable warmth, taste and sensitivity who was also saddled with a.dangerous and violent nature that could suddenly erupt into actions that were highly reckless and sometimes quite destructive in their consequences.In a Lonely Place (IALP) featured a mature and almost charismatic individual, who under the right set of circumstances could project significant charm and likability. But if Steele were ever confronted by an unexpected issue that upset him and stressed him out------his nature could undergo a traumatic and often menacing change for the worse. IALP's story spins a tale about how such a character reacted to personal problems that arose when he fell in love with a budding actress named Laurel Gray (played winningly by Gloria Grahame). As Bogart's psychopathic writer gets deeper into his relationship with Laurel and finds himself becoming dominated by conflicted feelings involving a lack of trust that leads to furious rage-----he descends into an unpleasant world of violence. In IALP, Bogart revealed his great art as an actor by making it completely believable for Steele to go from a pleasant fellow to an off-putting monster without loosing a beat. It is a spectacular performance-----one of his very best. Lauren Bacall was originally sought to play Laurel-----but Warner Brothers would not agree to the loan out arrangement. This fortuitous circumstance allowed the often underestimated Grahame to play perhaps the finest part of her career------certainly much better than her Oscar awarded role in The Bad and the Beautiful (1952).IALP is one of Nicholas Ray's most celebrated films, and he also contributed (uncredited) to the engrossing screenplay by Andrew Solt. IALP has a strong supporting cast featuring Frank Lovejoy, Jeff Donnell, Art Smith and Carl Benton Reid. Only Robert Warwick as the alcoholic elderly Shakespearian actor is a distraction with his somewhat over the top performance. The cinematography of Burnett Guffey should be singled out for special praise with its moody black and white presentation.IALP is a film that Bogart wanted to make, and he gives us in Dix Steele a character that probably comes the closest to reflecting his real life persona. Perhaps this may explain why Bogart did not particularly like the movie. In any event, IALP is a major artistic and critical success that has continued to gain in stature since its initial release. How much of Dix Steele ultimately crept into Bogart's later conception of Captain Queeg is a question best left to the consideration of his many appreciative fans.",28 June 2023

The film follows Remy, a rat who lives in the outskirts of France. Remy has a unique sense of smell and taste, which allows him to detect whether there is poison on food. With his new found gift, he was tasked to detect poison in the food which his other rat family eats. However, Remy finds himself in Paris, where he is stranded with nothing but his sense of taste and smell. In Paris, he meets Alfredo Linguini, a newly employed garbage boy at the restaurant, ""Gusteau's."" Linguini, a normal boy, doesn't exactly know how to cook, but has found himself in a pickle where he needs to prove himself to the new head chef of Gusteau's, Skinner. Somehow, Remy and Linguini team up in a nonverbal experiment where Remy guides Linguini to cook the most delicious foods imaginable. Throughout the movie, Remy and Linguini have to navigate life and ensure that their mutual relationship doesn't fall apart. Will they be able to maintain their relationship, and prove the food critics wrong? Find out by watching Pixar's Ratatouille.Throughout the movie, the term ""Anyone can cook"" gets thrown around a lot. This can be exemplified by the fact that a literal rat is able to use his senses to brew up amazing dishes even though he is just a rat. The term can be translated to much more than just cooking. The film presents a theme that anyone is capable of doing anything, and being able to break stereotypes is a part of human nature. Some other themes that were presented throughout the film include the fact that friendships can come in all shapes and sizes. These themes that are presented throughout the movie are themes that every child needs to experience in their lifetime in order to be a functioning member of society. If individuals don't adhere to these themes, then they're putting themselves at a disadvantage in life.In terms of breaking stereotypes, the film shows how just because Remy is a rat, it doesn't mean he isn't a great cook. He was able to create multiple dishes that impressed not only food critics, but those who despised him the most. Being able to break stereotypes in the real world is such a nifty tool to possess because you're able to shock people and be able to become memorable, and in this case, Remy was able to become memorable and be remembered as an untraditional cook. Going back to friendship, it is clear and present that a rat and a human shouldn't be friends, but that barrier was broken between Remy and Linguini. They illustrated that no matter the circumstance, two living beings are friends no matter their stature. Once again, this example is highly applicable to the real world in the sense that you don't have to look like someone to be best friends with them. In conclusion, Ratatouille is a classic children's film that allows kids to learn important themes of friendship and breaking stereotypes in an engaging way.",6 October 2023

",8,"This is one of those films that was made with the fans of a personality in mind, more than the rest of the public. This, however, is not exactly a problem in my eyes, it is rather a characteristic of this film, common to other biographical films that are centered on very popular figures such as sportsmen, musicians or others.Directed by Bryan Singer, the film covers the journey of the notable rock band ""Queen"" and its lead singer, Freddie Mercury, who immortalized himself with memorable performances and a sense of stage and spectacle that only big stars possess. Mercury was also notable for being one of the first major superstars to openly embrace his homosexuality and die of AIDS. As a biography, it is a very acceptable film and, as far as I was able to understand, it respects the essential aspects of the lives and artistic path of those concerned. Of course, being a film about a rock band, we cannot ignore the soundtrack, where we have the band's most famous and recognizable songs, and we can see a reenactment of the famous live performance they did at ""Live Aid"" in 1985, a one of the most acclaimed live musical performances ever in rock history.Obviously, the film was fated to financial success and, without any major surprises, and after weeks of advertising investment, it found great support from the public and became one of the biggest box office successes of that year. Critics also had no major objections and the film arrived at the Oscars as one of the favorites: out of a total of five nominations, it won four statuettes (Best Actor, Best Editing, Best Sound Mixing and Best Sound Editing) losing only for Best Film.In fact, in addition to the good songs and good script, the film offers us one of the best performances by Rami Malek, an actor who couldn't be better suited for the role of Freddie Mercury. In addition to all the physical similarities that he took advantage of to embody the character, he managed to interpret him in a dignified and respectful way, without transforming ""his"" Freddie into a kind of cheap imitation of the real person. However, as I watched the film, I couldn't help but feel that Malek was the only one in the scene who deserved the spotlight, and that the film lacked an equally good supporting cast that would give some charisma to the remaining band members, transformed into in extras in a story where only Mercury was taken into consideration.",22 November 2023

",6,"Several years in the making, Bohemian Rhapsody surpassed expectations at the box-office upon its release and it went on to become one of the highest grossing music biopics of all time.Rami Malek takes on the role of rock legend Freddie Mercury, one that was previously filled by actor Sacha Baron Cohen who famously left an early version of this project years ago, following creative differences. Cohen's version of the film promised sex, drugs and rock & roll aplenty: an R-rated, no holds barred, honest look at the singer's rockstar life. After the remaining members of Queen and the studio started having second thoughts about this particular approach, they set out to rebuild the movie in the way they wanted, without taking any big risks.And so Bohemian Rhapsody was born: a mainstream-friendly, Queen-centric biopic that aims to tell the story of Freddie Mercury with a slight emphasis on the positive and toxic relationships he made along the way. Despite its financial success, the film has received criticism for sugarcoating the late singer's life and not sticking to true events. Indeed, a lot of liberties were taken with certain key aspects of Mercury's life for dramatic convenience and this is definitely disappointing since so many other biopics fall into the exact same trap and it would have been so easy to avoid that.On the plus side, this is a gorgeous-looking film that builds up to an impressive (if often inaccurate) recreation of the classic Live Aid concert in Wembley. The music throughout is, of course, irresistible and, in fact, there just isn't enough time in the film to include all of Queen's biggest hits, which is in itself a testament to the band's legacy. While it would have been interesting to see Baron Cohen in the lead, it's hard to deny that Rami Malek was a fair casting choice. His Freddie Mercury is vulnerable yet powerful, lonely yet extravagant, awkward yet so talented it hurts. The casting in general is quite good in this film and there's an entertaining cameo by Mike Myers.By focusing on Mercury's relationship, and then friendship, with Mary Austin, the film touches upon a deep sadness that followed the singer over the years and could be felt through his songs. Unfortunately, the writing is far too uneven to convincingly elevate a film that mostly just wants to roughly celebrate a legendary singer's talent, play Queen songs and sell tickets.There are glimpses of a great biopic throughout Bohemian Rhapsody but the rushed storytelling, often clumsy script and lack of honesty hurts an otherwise entertaining and well made film with a solid lead performance.Enjoyable, if lightweight, biopic.",14 October 2023

",10,"As the credits rolled and the lights slowly brightened in the theater, I found myself still grappling with the emotional impact of the cinematic journey I had just experienced with ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."" Adapted from Ken Kesey's novel of the same name, this 1975 classic directed by Milos Forman is a triumph in storytelling, acting, and social commentary that continues to resonate with audiences decades later.At its core, the film is a poignant exploration of the human spirit's resilience against the oppressive constraints of a dehumanizing mental institution. Jack Nicholson, in what can only be described as a tour de force performance, takes on the role of Randle P. McMurphy, a rebellious and charismatic criminal who feigns insanity to escape the harshness of a prison sentence. Little does he know that his seemingly clever ploy lands him in the seemingly tranquil but profoundly oppressive confines of a mental institution ruled by the tyrannical Nurse Ratched, played with chilling precision by Louise Fletcher.The brilliance of Nicholson's portrayal lies in the seamless transition between McMurphy's apparent carefree bravado and the subtle vulnerability that lurks beneath the surface. From the very beginning, we are drawn to McMurphy's irreverent humor and devil-may-care attitude, making it easy to root for him as the underdog. However, as the layers of his character unfold, Nicholson reveals a depth that goes beyond mere bravado. McMurphy becomes a symbol of defiance against an institution that seeks to strip individuals of their autonomy and dignity.The film's supporting cast is equally exceptional, each contributing to the rich tapestry of characters that populate the mental ward. Chief Bromden, portrayed by Will Sampson, stands out as a silent observer whose internal struggles mirror the broader themes of societal oppression. The ensemble cast, including Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, and Brad Dourif, delivers performances that enhance the film's authenticity and emotional impact.What sets ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" apart is its ability to balance moments of dark humor with profound observations about the human condition. The seemingly mundane daily routines within the institution become a metaphor for the societal structures that stifle individuality and self-expression. The stark contrast between McMurphy's free-spirited approach and Nurse Ratched's calculated control serves as a microcosm of the broader power struggles that define the human experience.Milos Forman's direction deserves special commendation for capturing the claustrophobic atmosphere of the mental institution while allowing the characters' humanity to shine through. The use of symbolism, such as the recurring imagery of the fog that envelops Chief Bromden's perception, adds layers of complexity to the narrative. The film's cinematography, accompanied by a haunting score, enhances the emotional resonance of key moments, creating a cinematic experience that transcends its era.Beyond its technical and artistic achievements, ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" remains a powerful commentary on the dehumanizing effects of institutionalization. Nurse Ratched, with her cold and calculating demeanor, embodies the oppressive forces that seek to suppress individuality and enforce conformity. The film invites viewers to reflect on the nature of authority, conformity, and the price of rebellion in the face of societal expectations.In conclusion, ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is a cinematic masterpiece that stands the test of time. Its exploration of mental health, societal conformity, and the resilience of the human spirit resonates as strongly today as it did upon its release. Jack Nicholson's iconic performance, coupled with an outstanding supporting cast and Forman's deft direction, make this film a timeless classic that continues to captivate and provoke thought long after the credits roll.",26 December 2023

",6,"Milos Forman is a very famous and well-respected director. He has made several films that are regarded as classics, and some of his movies are amongst the films that have taken the highest number of academy awards ever. I've only watched two of his movies before this one, and quite ironically, it's hard to imagine two films (from those that I've reviewed), by the same director, with such an immense gap of quality between them. I'm talking about Amadeus, which is one of my favorite films ever (layered, well-paced, beautiful and full of interesting motifs) and Hair, which is...not. Hair is a movie that's pretty full of itself, thinking that it has a lot of charm while it actually has very little of it, and just generally has little to no substance besides the fun soundtrack. Too over-the-top and flat.So yeah, I didn't really know what to expect here, despite knowing how this movie is one of the only three to ever win all the big 5 academy awards. I think I was cautiously excited to watch, but unfortunately, again, I was disappointed.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a 1975 film, which was adapted from a critically-acclaimed book by the same name. The plot follows R. P McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a guy who's just arrived to a state mental hospital. McMurhphy, always chaotic and absolutely hates being told what to do, tries to get the ward to rebel against the strict Nurse Ratched, who's in charge there. This is the conflict in the heart of the film - authority and order versus freedom and, maybe, chaos.Let's start off with some of the things that I like about this movie: the cast is very, very solid. I feel like a wide arrange of actors are used here in a simple, yet effective, way (and this is maybe a compliment to the plot of the film as well): there is a wide cast of characters in the ward, each with its own mental issues, and all of them are portrayed really well by the actors. Taber (Christopher Lloyd) is violent, cynical and loves to pick a fight, Cheswick (Sydneny Lassick) is childish, clingy and very emotional, Martini (Danny DeVito) is almost floating on a cloud somewhere, always playing games in the wrongest way possible, smiling to himself. I could go on - they're all simple characters, but each has its own bits and gags, and I find it enjoyable. Entertaining, one might say. I like the bonds that are made between them and McMurphy, and I also enjoy the interactions they have with one another.I also generally like the cinematography. There are few shots that are really memorable to me but they're there, and things are generally well-shot and well-composed, and even though I can't say it has tons of uniqueness/ personality visually it's still pretty good.That being said, I think that it's time to address the biggest issue I'm having with this movie, funny as it may sound: it's just not that interesting. I mean, I wasn't bored for most of the runtime, but I also know that throughout most of this movie I could just stop watching and I probably wouldn't have had a desire to know what happens next. I didn't suffer while watching, but it wasn't gripping, wasn't moving. I can point out some scenes that I think are pretty good, like the party aftermath scene or the ""they just worked on him"" scene. But again, the actually GOOD material here is scarce, and I just don't feel the impact that people say this movie has on them. It's not really thought-provoking for me, nor does it make me view psychiatric wards in any new way.One other thing that really bothered me was how stupidly machoistic is this film's perception of freedom, how it focuses on sex and football and fishing like this is what freedom is. I mean, sure, Nurse Ratched could be seen as a villain - her little sadistic expressions, the shadow of a smile on her face when she does something that hurts others, the way she worships order, but still - the ideological clash that should be in the center of this movie feels quite hollow, considering the way in which it portrays this so-called ""freedom"". I get that the 1960's were a time of sexual awakening and they wanted to bring sex to the mainstream and stuff, making it less taboo, but it just feels sort of cringe and too over-the-top here, the way that it's being portrayed. It actually reminds me of Hair - the main character thinks that freedom means doing whatever you want, which makes him kind of a douchebag, which makes it harder to like him and his story resonating with me.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest, despite being well-directed, having a really solid cast and containing a decent amount of entertaining, fun gags and bits, is just not interesting enough for me to want to keep watching, throughout most of its runtime at least. I'm not having a bad time watching, and I do enjoy it overall, but it's too thin to really stick with me. Feeling a 6.0/10 on this one. Insanely overrated.P. S
I'm on a streak of disappointing movies, I really hope that my next review will be a really positive one.",12 December 2023

McMurphy, a charismatic and rebellious convict, feigns insanity to escape a prison work camp but finds himself ensnared in the rigid routines of a mental institution overseen by the stern Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). What unfolds is a gripping clash between the free-spirited McMurphy and the authoritarian rule of Nurse Ratched.At its essence, ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" serves as a poignant commentary on the dehumanizing effects of institutionalization. The film prompts viewers to question the blurred boundary between sanity and insanity, highlighting how societal norms can inadvertently stifle individual expression. Nicholson's portrayal of McMurphy becomes a symbol of rebellion, injecting vibrancy and defiance into an environment that thrives on conformity.The supporting cast, featuring standout performances by Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, and Brad Dourif, adds depth to the film, portraying a spectrum of mental states that mirror the diversity of the human experience. The camaraderie among the patients underscores a sense of shared humanity that transcends individual diagnoses.The film's cinematography, characterized by lingering shots and intimate close-ups, captures the emotional nuances of each character's journey. The use of a handheld camera immerses the audience in the chaotic energy of the institution, creating an atmosphere that is both confining and liberating. Jack Nitzsche's haunting score further enhances the emotional impact, punctuating key moments with a sense of impending catharsis.""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is more than a tale of rebellion; it's a contemplation of the human spirit's power to challenge societal norms and reclaim autonomy. The film's climax is an emotional tour de force, as the confrontation between McMurphy and Nurse Ratched reaches its pinnacle, leaving an enduring mark on the cinematic landscape.In summary, ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" stands as a cinematic triumph that surpasses its era, encouraging audiences to reflect on the boundaries of individuality and the consequences of blind conformity.

",7,"Milos Forman's second American feature is a loose adaptation of the novel by Ken Kesey that made so many changes that Kesey refused to ever watch it. Having never read the book, I can't comment on changes, but I can say that this is one of those Best Picture winners and well-loved films that I never quite get. I think it's a good film, well-made, acted, and lensed, but I don't get into the emotional groove its offering, feeling more distant from the action than it seems like most audiences do. It's a film I respect more for its craft than I actually enjoy watching.I think I never quite love this film because I never quite hate Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). It really feels like the love of the film comes from hating her character, but I see her as a flawed human being with good intentions counterbalanced by a real mean streak that she's not afraid of using (what she does to Billy (Brad Dourif) at the end is outright evil). She's a bad person, but not a devil, so I can never quite get around to hating her and feeling some great joy at watching her attacked. It's helped by the fact that I see Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) as less purely good and more dangerous than I think other people see him as. Again, he's not a bad person, but he can't control himself and puts himself in a spot where he's willing to harm sick people around him to win a fight with Ratched.So, McMurphy was in jail for a series of assaults and convinced the state prison psychiatrists that he needed to be sent to the funny farm, the mental hospital. He shows up, and he finds seventeen patients, all largely placid in their own ways and under the heel of Nurse Ratched. What follows is a power struggle between McMurphy and Ratched. They have dueling philosophies on life, and those manifest in different little struggles, all with both of them using the other patients as tools.If you see the film as McMurphy just trying to get people to discover their true selves and Ratched trying to oppress them, it becomes a very easy to root for one over the other. The problem is that I see them both as using these people in their fight with each other. McMurphy forces Bancini (Josip Elic) to put him on his shoulders without his consent to run around and try to show Chief (Will Sampson) how to play basketball. Was that kind? It seems at least kind of mean to me. It may not be Ratched arranging electric shock therapy, but it's also not McMurphy trying to help Bancini at all, instead using him to try and find a way to have fun.McMurphy's open defiance of Ratched makes him something of a figure of awe among the patients, especially Billy, and he even gets the grudging respect of others like Harding (William Redfield) and Max (Christopher Lloyd). His desire to break loose and have fun is a great feeling for these people on tightly run schedules (so tightly run that Ratched refuses to change anything to let them watch the World Series) who love the sense of freedom, but they are also really sick people and taking them out of the hospital to steal a boat to fish on was not exactly great. That they all end up reacting well feels somewhat artificial to me. At least one of these people should have had some kind of breakdown, otherwise it's intentionally stacking the deck in McMurphy's favor. He takes them out of the hospital, some of whom are there by force of the state, and they're all fine. Either this is saying that these people shouldn't be locked up at all (which, considering Billy's fate later, seems to be a poor assumption) or that they just need to get out a bit. I think that the best way to read this is that the psychological approaches of the time were backwards and destructive, but that implies that these people needed it as well.You see, my issue is that ultimately I feel like there's an intentional subtext here about society and competing views between control (Ratched) and freedom (McMurphy), but the application to the setting of the mental asylum is imprecise to the point of distraction.I find it hard to separate that subtext from the narrative surface, but the surface is where things work better. The characters are all very well drawn, starting with McMurphy, this guy trapped in a place that he didn't realize the implications of when he schemed to get in. As played by Nicholson, he's cocky and confident until he realizes the trap he's set for himself, using everything he has to jump around, domineer the patients, and try to have a good time. The patients all around him are convincing, especially with those early turns from Dourif, Danny DeVito, and Lloyd. Dourif ends up the tragic figure in the end, harshly manipulated by Ratched with one single line of dialogue when it becomes obvious that he won't listen to her anymore. Fletcher has a restrained performance, and she loves her control in small ways, never lording it over people except in her cool, calm voice. Her lashing out is in what she says, never in how she says it.I feel for Billy and where he goes. He was a mentally ill young man manipulated by both people over him, one far more maliciously than the other. What happens to McMurphy is the result of an uncaring system and a powermad woman, but he's less the hero than I think the film thinks he is. I see it as an imperfect application of Forman's experiences under communist rule during his upbringing in Czechoslovakia to the American experience. I appreciate Forman's craft in molding performances from his actors, clean filming, careful use of closeups, and general production quality, and I feel some sympathy for a side character, but I think it doesn't quite hit as well as it should.

rw9384631,ur2863499,tt0073486," R. P. McMurphy gives 20th century institutionalism a heavy blow
",9,"20th century psychiatry and institutionalism were given a heavy, but arguably well-deserved and nuanced blow when Milos Forman adapted Ken Kesey's acclaimed novel about mental illnesses and treatments - and, according to Kesey and Forman, the often heavy discrepancies between the two. The site is an arguably fairly run-of-the-mill mental asylum in the 1970s, the cast of characters an expected collection of nervous, delusional, schizophrenic and/or psychotic men. And then there is R. P. McMurphy, a 30-something short-tempered but good-hearted rebel who seems to never have grown up. He is serving a sentence for petty crimes and jumps on the chance to become transferred to a mental institution, which he believes will be a more relaxing serving of his sentence than regular prison labour camps. And through Jack Nicholson's perfectly identifiable McMurphy, a character most of us have either been, befriended or dated at some point during our youth, Forman paints the darkest of his many dark portraits of institutionalism. The cold-hearted administrator Nurse Ratched comes off and feels as a large-scale movie villain, but the most scary interpretation of her is that she's not evil, but simply too arrogant and soulless to realize that the theories and doctrines she bases her choices on are wrong. Ratched was probably a dead-ringer for numerous doctors and nurses working in mental institutions during the mid 20th century.Seen with a great deal of distance, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest's social criticism may not be as relevant anymore; institutions and mental health care has gone through major reforms since. But the film, like so many of Milos Forman's other films, still works brilliantly because of the vibrant human drama it offers. Jack Nicholson is seething with energy, and the interplay between him and a chillingly authentic Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched elevates the drama to thriller-level suspense. There are also a number of fine supporting performances, the best of which belongs to Brad Dourif in what must be one of the best screen-debuts of all time. To say his career never lived up to this promise would be an enormous understatement, but his work as Billy Bibbit lives on, and so does the rest of Forman's tragic and well-aimed elegy.",19 October 2023

To make matters worse Mildred's oldest daughter is cold, manipulative, haughty and seems to care little other than for herself. The family we learn once had much money and the daughter has become accustomed to a higher standard of living.

Mildred has to strive hard to protect and provide for her family, the men in her life tend to let her down, yet her daughter seems to believe still that work is unworthy of a lady, and that she should simply be living the life of a high society socialite.

",9,"Well, Joan was certainly the big name here, but I found the performance of Ann Blyth to be the tour de force of this interesting tale, which I also note seemed more Hitchcockian than strictly film-noir. Blyth thoroughly sold her role in every scene in which Veda appears. One really believes she is the spoiled child she portrays! And she was quite young and relatively inexperienced upon taking the role--a nod to both her and her director. Her character was considered by The American Film Institute as one of Hollywood's greatest villains.I'm not a melodrama lover, so this aspect of the screenplay was not a draw for me. Why did the younger daughter have to die?---I found that a peculiar plot annoyance. Finally, given the excellent story and the age of the film, I can't help but think that a modern remake would do the story well; but then, we wouldn't get Joan, would we?

",5,"This film had all the bells and whistles; a great director, great music, a solid cast, and great cinematography. But if you dont have a good script, none of the above matter. In my opinion, the script for this film was highly unbelievable. Yes, it is a great mohter-daughter movie, but that is just not enough. The situations in the film have to be believable. Actions of the characters have to be plausable. Neither of those two variables seemed to be working in this film for me.I spoil my son; but not nearly as much as Mildred spoils her daughter. The film violates the ""once burned, shame on you; twice burned, shame on me principle. Mildred doesnt just get burned twice by her daughter, but also by her romantic interest as well! So, shame on her. At that point, we lose whatever empathy we had for Mildred during the earlier events in the film. It is pretty good as a soap, in the tradition of Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman, which has more twists and turns in life than you would have in six lives.

The police are called and Mildred tells the story of herself, her men, and, specifically, her spoiled daughter, Veda. Veda is the ungrateful daughter who gets everything she wants.

Fortunately, my daughters overcame that self-centered and selfish view of their lives (likely contributed to by much indulgence on my part) and became lovely, responsible and forgiving women.In this beautifully crafted and classic noir adaptation, poor Mildred never quite gets the hang of child-rearing. She has the fortitude to ax worthless husbands, the ambition to create a booming chain of drive-in restaurants from a selling kitchen pies beginning and the instinct to not only avoid a lecherous Jack Carson but use him to her ends. But she's a sap for her daughter Veda, who's been playing her like a violin with parental guilt since a pre-teen.The film hits on all cylinders. It's well- mounted. Noir often use flashbacks to tell murder who-done-its and ""Mildred"" does it extremely well. The scrip is witty; cynically so.

",10,"Most great actors from the golden age of movies have that one defining film associated with them that made a huge mark on movie history. Clark Gable had Gone With the Wind. For Humphrey Bogart, the answer's obvious: Casablanca. Orson Welles had quite a few, but ultimately, you have to give it to Citizen Kane. For Joan Crawford's defining role, we arrive at the outstanding noir of Mildred Pierce. Despite being almost 2 whole hours, this movie's storyline is so well put together that it's able to hold the attention of even current day audiences without issue. It shows perfectly well how spoiling a kid is rarely a good idea, and how even a mother's attachment to her own child can be strained (or even severed) due to putting trust in a hedonist too many times. The film starts with a man named Monte Beragon (Zachary Scott) being gunned down in a beach house by some unknown attacker. His widow, Mildred Pierce (Joan Crawford) is questioned by the police in a detective's office, and they feel confident that they have the murderer in custody already: Bert Pierce (Bruce Bennett), Mildred's first husband. Mildred finds this idea ridiculous, as she says Bert is too nice and moderate to kill someone. In a flashback which encompasses the rest of the film, Mildred recounts her side of the story as to how (and why) Monte was killed. Some time ago, Bert and Mildred were a couple, but Bert seems to be irritated by everything his wife does and says. Bert has a coworker named Wally (Jack Carson), who has shut him out recently, which in turn has harmed Bert's ability to provide for Mildred and her two daughters, Veda and Kay. Bert and Mildred decide to separate after the latter discovers her husband has been seeing a woman named Mrs. Biederhof behind her back. Meanwhile, Mildred is forced to take care of Veda and Kay all by herself. Mildred gets a job at a bakery, which leads to Veda (Ann Blyth) mocking her mother for having to work for a living. As the movie goes on, Veda becomes a total brat. In order to try and quench her daughter's thirst for material possessions, Mildred and Wally meet Monte at a large property he has put up for sale and say they want to buy it. Once the place is in Mildred's hands, she turns it into a restaurant, and Monte starts wanting to be with her. However, Kay, only 10 years old, later dies of pneumonia from seemingly out of nowhere. A depressed Mildred becomes a workaholic in order to distract herself from her child's death. Soon, Mildred is able to garner enough money to open new restaurants throughout California. While this is going on, Veda becomes more and more addicted to wealth, mostly due to her hanging around Monte. She starts smoking, Monte buys her a car, and she marries a boy at only 17. When her mother finds out, she forces Monte to annul the marriage for her. Veda lies and says she's pregnant, which leads to Monte giving her extra money to support her child. After she brags to her mother about how she succeeded in fooling him, Mildred disowns her. While Mildred tries to forget about her bratty daughter, Bert calls her and tells her to meet him at a nightclub Wally owns, as he has something to show her. When Mildred walks in, she's shocked to see Veda dancing onstage in revealing clothes as sailors in the audience whistle at her. Mildred tries to beg Veda in her dressing room to come back to her old life, but Veda says she's her own person now and her mother is too poor to give her the life she wants. Defeated, Mildred leaves. In a last ditch attempt to get her daughter back, Mildred marries Monte, to whom she has no affection, in the hopes that his wealth will bring her home. It works. Bert shows up one day and says Veda came back willingly with him to be with her mom. Although she has Veda back, Monte is now getting out of hand. He uses a sneaky tactic that involves him holding on to his shares of Mildred's restaurants while she's forced to give up her's. As a result, Mildred goes broke and has to close all her establishments. Enraged, she confronts Monte at the beach house from the beginning of the movie, and sees him drunk embracing Veda. Mildred intends to shoot him, but drops her gun and runs outside instead. Veda then uses the pistol on Monte, and foolishly tells her mother she murdered him. By now, Mildred has had enough of her daughter's constant lying and fake forgiveness, so she calls the cops on her. However, Mildred has a change of heart and agrees to hide her daughter, since she's all she has left now. The movie then comes full circle. The cops tell Mildred all the other suspects in Monte's murder case are being let go because they have the real culprit now: Veda. Still not apologetic, she's sent off to prison as her mother meets with Bert outside the precinct. What a wonderful movie. With film noir being among my favorite genres, it wasn't easy finding a film that actually exceeded my expectations, but Mildred Pierce hits the ball out of the park. The characters and the way their unique personalities are displayed couldn't have gone any better. Crawford puts on the performance that would become the highlight of her career, as she plays a mother with her back up against the wall. She does (and buys) everything her daughter wants, but it isn't enough. Ann Blyth is absolutely devilish. She's arrogant, she's a liar, and has basically no shame. She wants everybody (not least of all her mother) to know about her sexual endeavors, and tells Mildred right to her face that she's too good for her. Not to mention, the twist of seeing her be the one to kill Monte. I mean who could have seen that coming? I don't say this for many films, but Mildred Pierce is one of the best of a genre. If I had to pick a movie to represent noir, it has a good chance of being this.",1 January 2023

The Wild Bunch was the nail in the coffin with bloodthirsty idiots and bandits abound, a shocking amount of real blood and a general sense of pointless carnage. The film consists mostly of these brutal shoot-outs, which are executed quite decently. The entire setting and characters are choreographed perfectly to give the sense of incredible chaos and tension, ensuring the audience is on the edge of their seats as anyone can (and does) die at any time. The characterisation is heavily flawed from the beginning, as everyone involved is a bloodthirsty, vengeful bandit in some way or another, with innocent townsfolk in the way of their constant battles.

rw9411572,ur31328960,tt0065214," Some viewers have interpreted Peckinpah's love for a good western as over the hill ... like this gang was
",8,"Was this Director's Sam Pekinpah's last western? The answer is yes but not because he wanted it to be. I think this was Peckinpah's last western because of a number of varying reasons he did not have much control over such as the changing times. Liberal thinkers were always saying the violence was too much, native people were being wrongfully disparaged and simply put some of the younger up and coming actors just didn't want to become stereotyped as a western ""John Wayne"" type of cowboy star. Add these barriers and the cost of westerns was just too much for the relatively young 44 year old writer/director to have to deal with anymore.So for a last hurrah to the western genre Peckinpah slyly drew together like minded thinkers such as actors William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Robert Ryan, Warren Oates, Ben Johnson, L. Q. Jones, Bo Hopkins and the affable Strother Martin to make one last wetsern as a sort of homage to the waning western film genre.In my humble opinion it worked to perfection. In any western you have to have an anti-hero as well as a villain and in this case the villain was the Mexicans since native Indians were too sensitive by 1969 to be cast as the villains any longer.This is an excellent film, an even better story about comrardery and loyalty and dying for what you believe in, whether it be on the right side of the local law or not.

rw9378385,ur53053227,tt0065214," A good Western, with some problems that prevent it from being excellent.
",5,"Personally, I think that Western is a genre of cinema focused on entertainment and action, and I think that is generally correct. I haven't seen many Western films that can be said to be great (although they exist). This film is good, it is beyond average, but it is not free from problems and imperfections.The plot is based on a gang that carries out its latest bank robbery. They know that, in the 20th century, they are part of a dying world and times are changed. Things go wrong: it was a trap set up by the authorities, and this forces them to cross the border into Mexico and spend an insane amount of time looking over their shoulders while a group of bloodthirsty bounty hunters with few scruples set off in pursuit, and get closer to their objective.The plot is nothing special. We've seen this countless times. The epicenter and soul of Westerns is often about the duel between criminals and the forces of law, and it often shows that there is very little difference between them. However, this does not pose any problem. The film's first big problem is its excessive length and slow pace: the action is interrupted by a set of scenes of small interest or irrelevant dialogues: after an hour of running time, I simply wanted them to kill everyone. Some part of these scenes was an attempt to better develop a core of main characters. However, the effort fails because they are unable to be interesting, the connection that binds the audience to them does not exist.Directed by Sam Peckinpah, it's a regular film which relies on good action scenes with some sensationalism. Good actors with vast experience give us an elegant and committed effort, particularly William Holden, Albert Dekker, Ernest Borgnine and Robert Ryan, and it is worth seeing the way they bring the characters to life. The action is there and is explosive, there is no concern about sparing civilians and the result is complete carnage. Cinematography is quite good, the effects too, the filming locations are very effective. The soundtrack is understandable, but it is not pleasant.",15 October 2023
rw9299873,ur0547823,tt0065214," a milestone in the history of the genre of Western
",10,"The scene that opens Sam Peckinpah's 1969 'The Wild Bunch' immediately reminds fans of the western genre of John Sturges' 'The Magnificent Seven' made in 1960. A group of riders enter a small town in the Wild West (rather the Wild South - Texas, in this case). The visual resemblance is deceiving. Disguised as soldiers, they come not to defend or save the town but to rob the bank. The radical change in approach reflected the fact that in the decade between 1960 and 1969 just about everything had changed in American cinema. 'The Wild Bunch' is an auteur film, personal and violent, with a naturalistic expressivity and a moral ambiguity that the Hollywood censorship system (the film was produced by Warner Bros. Studios) abandoned a few years before would not have allowed ever to be filmed and distributed. The Western did not escape this revolution. The European Sergio Leone's films provided a liberated alternative, and Arthur Penn's 1967 'Bonnie and Clyde' brought bad guys (and gals) into the mainstream and violence on big-screens. Inspired by these models, Sam Peckinpah made his contribution with this film, controversial at its release as only Tarantino's films would be a quarter of a century later, completely changing and freeing the direction of the Western movies genre.The story takes place in the year 1913, celebrated in Europe and throughout the world as the last year of an order that had lasted for about a century. Social conflicts, economic inequalities, political rivalries smouldered everywhere in the world, predicting the upheavals and catastrophes of the 20th century, which would not bypass anyone anywhere. New transportation and communication technologies were improving people's lives, but at the same time weapons and explosives were being perfected. Texas did not escape. The film's heroes belong to a decaying world that has largely disappeared. A gang of villains led by Pike Bishop makes a living (and some of them find their deaths) from one hit to the next, robbing banks and attacking trains. On their trail is a group of bounty hunters whose leader, Deke Thompson, is a former member of the gang, once betrayed by Pike and abandoned to prison and the blackmail of corrupt authorities. The story takes place in the north but also in the south of the American-Mexican border, where armed militias are at war with each other and with the Mexican army. The victims, on either side of the border, are often innocent people. At the beginning and at the end of the film we witness two scenes, cinematically anthological, of armed duels between the 'wild bunch' and their followers which would be called if they happened today as 'urban massacres' and which take place on both sides of the border. There are no good guys in this movie. Characters are bad or very bad guys. Faced with the extinction of their way of life, belated western heroes in a changing world, the characters act in the only way they know: violently. There is a 'code' of honor with military overtones (the wounded or prisoners are not abandoned), but these rules are often broken and the results only amplify the horror.'The Wild Bunch' takes from the great American films of the genre the characteristic landscapes - the deserts, the burning sun, the distant horizons, the silhouettes of people crushed by nature. It is probably cinematographer Lucien Ballard's best-known film, but he had already accompanied Stanley Kubrick's feature film debut with 'The Killing' in 1956. For Sam Peckinpah but also for Henry Hathaway he was the favorite cinematographer. Lou Lombardo's editing alternates between long and short shots and is extremely effective in the gun duel scenes. The scenes of the train robbery and the one of blowing up a bridge are also excellently shot. Among the actors chosen by Sam Peckinpah, I must mention William Holden - an active and popular actor at the time, today a little forgotten - and especially Ernest Borgnine, an extremely prolific actor (210 roles in his filmography!), with an unmistakable physiognomy , who here receives a role up to his talent.I haven't had a chance to see 'The Wild Bunch' until now. Probably in 1969, this violent and morally ambiguous film did not pass the censorship filters of the communist country I was living in. Now, 54 years after it was made, it doesn't seem to have aged a by single frame. For me it's the best movie I've seen this year.",2 September 2023

Large, hard-bodied races like the Vikings; Of course, having such a child in the village they call Berk adds strangeness to the situation. They both appealed to curiosity in this direction by making use of viking mythology and reflected the imagination of the lower age group by including dragons.For example, there is a character they call Hiccup, who wants to be strong like the people seen in the survivors. We all start to study something as a role model when we are children. But in cases where this is not possible, we seek a certain adventure and discover ourselves, as our characters do. Of course, even if there is no 'toothless', everyone works with hope. Depicting extinct, predatory creatures like dragons in this way gives viewers different emotions.

People regarded him as a trouble, and he needed an opportunity to make him feel the value of existence; Toothless, who has never been seen by anyone, always comes and goes without a trace, destroying opponents in an instant. The most ferocious, evil, and dangerous creature in legend has never been truly understood by anyone. When Toothless, who was bound, faced Hiccup's four eyes with a butcher's knife held high, a relationship about belonging and mutual trust and dependence began, and ultimately remained resilient after facing countless hardships and tests. This kind of relationship is something we wait for in reality, but it is always difficult to find. Whether it is love or friendship, in reality, they face too many desires and temptations, which makes them too fragile. With such a theme, ""Dragon Taming"" no longer needs to carry the cruelty of reality like Pixar's works. It only needs to create a dream that belongs to children, but can also make adults feel happy and even moved, and it will be successful.",19 October 2023

",8,"This never took my fancy as a kid, simply because I wasn't interested in dragons in the slightest, so I never watched it, even despite my best friend from that period constantly going on about it over the years. But now as a grown adult, but more importantly as a cinephile, I decided to give this a go, especially after I was immensely surprised by the incredibly high ratings that this has received. And I definitely understand where these acclamatory reviews are coming from, as there is a beautiful story which unravels before us.I really liked how the story was sort of split into two. It eminently highlighted how Hiccup had to lead a double life, including a life where he felt no sense of belonging, it was sadly quite relatable! I also took delight in the sequence where Hiccup learns several new skills from Toothless, and then implements each one into his dragon-fighting training, it was a great way of quickly developing the plot, and very entertaining too.I adore the score, most notably Test Drive, it's an absolute masterpiece, but the soundtrack as a whole is genuinely tremendous, I'm so glad it was recognized by the Academy, what with it being given an Oscar nomination.As for negatives, I found it bizarre, and mildly annoying, that all the children had American accents and the adults had Scottish accents. If they are Vikings, and this is set in Scotland, then surely they should all have Scottish accents? It's just disappointing, and it actually lost me in the Immersion a little bit.Also, this film made me realise how much I hate the way relationships are portrayed in family movies. It's honestly infuriating how this picture sticks to the typical romance tropes that you see in almost all other family-friendly films, where the guy wins the girl through doing nothing else but impressing her. You can see it coming from a mile away.When it comes to the animations, almost everything was decent. The one aspect that was poorly executed were the beards of the Vikings, most noticeably Stoick's. They couldn't have looked more computer-generated.Finally though, I'll end on a good note by saying that what elevated this to a 8/10 for me was the shocking twist that we see when Hiccup gets out of bed, it was completely unexpected, and a decision by the writers that I truly admire.So overall, a fantastic feature, one that was much better than I thought it would be.",10 October 2023

It was a huge disappointment. Would have been much better and believable with someone like Kevin Costner in the William Hale role -- DeNiro is simply unbelievable as an Okie/Texas rancher. It's like a mafia gangster trying to play a Texas cowboy... very poor choice in casting.Ernest Burkhart should have been played by much younger man as he had only returned from fighting in WW1 at the beginning of the movie. I would have picked Jefferson White (Jimmy from Yellowstone) as he is the right age, able to portray the moral ambivalence, and would have done a terrific job.Scorsese definitely has an ego and could benefit from a good editor -- the movie did not need to be almost 4 hours long. Oh how I wish Taylor Sheridan had produced and/or directed this movie.The true hero of this very tragic true story is Tom White and his role was not brought to the forefront. Without Tom White the killers would never have been brought to justice. J Edgar Hoover was missing from the movie and Tom White would not have been sent to Oklahoma but for him. There was quite a bit of back and forth between White and Hoover -- again missing from the movie.Only right spot in the entire casting was Lily Gladstone -- she should receive an award for simply having to act with DeNiro and Dicaprio. She did a terrific job but was underutilized.This was an ego project for a bunch of folks who have no business attempting to portray anything in 1920-30's Oklahoma.

",8,"Based on David Grann's book, killers Of The Flower Moon captures a tragic history of systematic murder of the Osage people for their oil wealth. Scorsese vividly captures the themes of greed, exploitation and power play in this chilling non fiction story. He also unapologetically displays the culture of the Osage people in their dress, music, funeral and superstitious beliefs. One does not only appreciate the level of callousness and deceitfulness demonstrated by these greedy ""wolves"" but one is also sucked into the culture and life of the Osage people in a way you could imagine it when reading the book. As far as the 3 leading characters are concerned, Leonardo DiCaprio's character as Ernest Burkhart was played to perfection. He was servant in the US army infantry division and came to live with and work for his uncle. However, his inability to reflect deeply on the consequences of orders given to him by his uncle made him a tool that was used in perpetrating the heinous crimes committed by his uncle in order to have the headrights to his wife's family oil wealth. He was also a morally conflicted man who in a way tried to convince and deceive himself that he was doing the right thing by obeying his uncle's orders. Lily Gladstone as Mollie Burkhart was the soul of this story. She symbolizes the irreversible physical and emotional damage the genocide had on families. Her subtle, soulful, haunting and emotionally alluring portrayal of Mollie Burkhart was an outstanding achievement and one for the ages. This is a movie that gets better with each watch and its only when considerable time has passed before cinephiles and film critics will realize how truly outstanding this movie is.",4 January 2024

",8,"A stunning exploration of the banality of evil centers on Ernest Burkhart, played brilliantly and powerfully by DiCaprio. Sometimes I blinked and saw not an actor, but a real criminal from black and white photographs of the century before last - limited, evil, greedy, with the face of degradation. And most importantly, he is a master at lying to himself.This is amazing - how can you feel good while killing your wife's relatives, the mother of your children? How can you believe that you are a loving husband (he believes, that's what's amazing!) when you inject your wife with a drug that clearly makes her worse. I had a strange association that Ernest, as if under a magnifying glass, showed the same effect of a split psyche as the population of totalitarian aggressor countries, whose population also convinced and continues to convince themselves of their innocence. That evil manifested with their consent is the will of God (or the leader, or the will of the uncle) - and I am actually not a monster (approving genocide, committing bloodshed), not a murderer, I am good. I take care of my wife. I injected her with poison and then carefully combed her hair...
DiCaprio and Scorsese brilliantly embodied this character. It's a banality of evil that's impossible to believe and that sucks Molly in like sticky swamp mud.But I admit, I couldn't watch the movie without interruption. I needed a drink, a snack and just to get up. Although the direction and cinematography are beautiful and I didn't get bored, it was physically difficult for me to spend so much time sitting in front of the screen.

",9,"IN A NUTSHELL:
They had me at Martin Scorsese. His directing is fantastic but that's not news. He also worked as a screenwriter and producer on the film. He said that he knew he wanted to make the story into a movie as he was reading the book ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" by David Grann. He spent hours with Chief Standing Bear of the Osage Nation to grant permission to film it. About the movie, Scorsese said, ""It's not a whodunnit. It's a who-didn't-do-it.""
The screenplay was written by Eric Roth and Martin Scorsese. I'm sure we'll see this nominated for Best Picture.THINGS I LIKED:
The stellar cast includes Academy Award winners Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Brendan Fraser. Multi-award winners John Lithgow and Jesse Plemons round out the star-studded cast. Other noteworthy cast members are Lily Gladstone, Tantoo Cardinal, William Belleau, and Louis Cancelmi.I've been a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio since his earliest films and always thought he was a talented chameleon. He truly transformed into the character Ernest Burkhart in this movie. DiCaprio was paid $30 million for this movie, the most money of his career for one film.Robert De Niro looks fantastic. He's 80 years old but played a character who was 45-years old when these murders happened.Director Martin Scorsese quickly selected Lily Gladstone for her role because of the ""truthfulness in her eyes"" when they met over Zoom.Stunning cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto.We get to learn about Indian culture, language, and even an explanation of what the Flower Moon is.This was the last movie of actor Larry Sellers who was actually of Osage and Cherokee Indian descent.While there are Hollywood liberties taken with the film, it's based on a true story.I love how Scorsese incorporated the look and feel of black and white photos into the development of the story.Fun fact: We learn in the movie that it was the investigation of the murders in Osage County that was the first case given to the newly-formed Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). President J. Edgar Hoover led the case.The movie cost $200 million to make. It's officially the most expensive biographical movie ever made.The movie was filmed in Oklahoma.The ending was powerful. I loved the idea and thought it was very clever to reveal the rest of the story through a radio show reenactment.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
This movie is VERY long! While Scorsese is lauded as royalty in Hollywood, a really long movie is often a sign of indulgence by a director who doesn't have the grit to make needed edits. The story could have been told in much less time. Surprisingly, this movie is only 3 minutes longer than Scorsese's film The Irishman.I wanted to see the moment Leonardo DiCaprio's character fell in love with Lily Gladstone's character. I wanted that first, magical kiss. Instead, it goes from mild flirting in one scene to making out in the next.Rather than tell the story in a simple chronological order, it would have been more interesting to reveal various parts as the FBI uncovered them in their investigation.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This is not an appropriate movie for kids. They'll probably be bored anyway.Profanity, including F-bombs

Most people believe these are good movies because the critics tell you they are, but if you can watch them with an open mind you'll realize how terrible they all are.

Noir lovers seem especially obsessed with the scalding coffee in a woman's face scene -- I could live the rest of my life without being subjected to that in a movie. But I've learned my lesson.

Dave Banion (Glenn Ford) against a crime syndicate run by Mike Lagana (Alexander Scourby).The film starts with the suicide of police officer Tom Duncan. Unfortunately, his widow finds the body first and removes his suicide letter. She then proceeds to use the letter to blackmail or extort funds from Lagana...leaving the investigative detective Banion without a lot to go on except a vague idea that his suicide might be due to his health, that is until a bar fly named Lucy Chapman calls him with a very different story. When Lucy Chapman then ends up tortured, beaten and very dead Sgt. Banion puts two and two together to get Lagana. Unfortunately, Lagana has politicians...like the police commissioner in his pocket and after a failed attempt to kill Banion, which results in the death of his lovely wife, Banion knowing they won't go after the real culprits quits and takes matters into his own hands.It's at this junction that he places his daughter under the protection of his brother-in-law and gets help from an unlikely source...Debbie Marsh, Lagana's right hand's girlfriend. This eventually leads to an epic shootout between the brutal Vince Stone (Lagana's right hand) and Banion.I can't tell you too much more without giving away some of the surprises in this film. Warning: there is some pretty brutal violence against women. I do think it makes the film even harder hitting for it's brutality. In contrast with this dark material are these beautiful domestic scenes between Banion and his wife. They have a poor but loving home, that stands out against the excess seen amongst the mob players...especially two greedy women, one of which comes sashaying on camera with a cocktail in her hand.

A. Confidential' (1997) and 'The Departed' (2006), both films I enjoyed despite my expectations of them and this one was no different for it's age. It was definitely better than the 1974 ""Film Noir"" detective story 'Chinatown'.I could see why it still retains its 15 rating all these years later, as it was quite callous with regards to its attitudes to life and murder. The way they discussed things was quite gory and horrific in some ways too.If it was made today, they would be less inclined to shy away from the blood splattering the walls of course, but actually it really didn't need that to get the point across. The only thing was, that the close ups, being slightly less offensive to the viewer, were not as realistic as we have come to expect after all this time and from seeing all the films that use blood and violence just for the sake of it.Lee Marvin in particular played a really nasty piece of work in the role of Vince Stone. The character obviously had no conscience or fear of going to Hell.The rest of the cast all did a good job too.This was another good film that I am pleased to say that I've seen. It's not one that I would rush back to see again, but I'd certainly recommend it to other people with an interest in the history and culture of film.

Prove me wrong, America.Half of the fun is figuring out who or which group is getting ripped on. Nigel Tufnel's wife is clearly a riff on Linda McCartney/Yoko Ono. The dead drummer meme is inspired by the deaths of Keith Moon and John Bonham of The Who and Led Zeppelin, respectively. And manager Ian Faith smashing up hotel rooms with his cricket bat is Keith Moon all the way. Tufnel, St Hubbins and Smalls trying to sing Heartbreak Hotel at Elvis's gravesite is The Who doing Barbara Ann for The Kids Are Alright. The Flower People song is The Moody Blues. Stonehenge is Jethro Tull. Michael McKeen is parodying Mick Jagger (his voice, anyway). Tufnel's solos are Eddie Van Halen. Harry Shearer is channeling John Entwistle. The Puppet Show festival concert is Yes or Emerson Lake & Palmer. Tap's hit album in Japan is Cheap Trick (even Tufnel's line delivery is part of the joke, ""He asked Me.

The Who and Queen hadn't even reformed for Live Aid yet, much less gone on retro tours for another 40 years. The Stones hadn't quite descended into self-satire.Watch for cameos by Dana Carvey and Billy Crystal as mimes/servers at the Spinal Tap launch party for their North American tour.

Directed by Rob Reiner and written by its stars Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer, this film has rightfully earned its place in the pantheon of cult classics.The brilliance of ""This Is Spinal Tap"" lies in its genius concept and its pitch-perfect execution. The film follows the fictional rock band Spinal Tap on a tumultuous tour, capturing the absurdity, ego, and chaos of the rock 'n' roll world. The mockumentary style allows for a seamless blend of improvisation and scripted hilarity, making every scene feel spontaneous and fresh.The characters are a comedic tour de force. From David St. Hubbins (McKean) to Nigel Tufnel (Guest) and Derek Smalls (Shearer), each band member is a caricature of rock stereotypes, with their quirks and idiosyncrasies pushed to the extreme. Their absurd conversations and exaggerated personalities never fail to elicit laughter.The satirical jabs at the music industry and the rock star lifestyle are both sharp and affectionate. The film expertly parodies the excesses of the era, from the over-the-top stage props (Stonehenge, anyone?) to the band's revolving door of drummers, each meeting a bizarre or unfortunate fate. It's an incisive critique of the superficiality and absurdity of the music business.The film's iconic moments are too numerous to count, from the band's inability to find the stage, the infamous amp that goes to eleven, to the hilarious and cringe-worthy lyrics of their songs. The humor is incredibly clever and resonates with anyone who has ever been a fan of rock music.The genius of ""This Is Spinal Tap"" lies in its timeless appeal. Even though it was made in the 1980s, its humor and satire are as relevant today as they were then. This is a film that can be watched and re-watched, with every viewing revealing new layers of wit and absurdity.The authenticity of the performances is remarkable, as the actors convincingly portray their characters as real people, blurring the lines between fiction and reality. The commitment to their roles is commendable and adds to the film's immersion.""This Is Spinal Tap"" is an uproarious, unforgettable journey into the world of rock and its larger-than-life personalities. With its unparalleled wit, memorable characters, and timeless satire, it's a film that never goes out of style.

",5,"In the year 1982, filmmaker and super fan Marty DiBergi decides to make a film on legendary English heavy metal band Spinal Tap on what is to be their US comeback tour. Will Spinal Tap be able to replicate their earlier success or will this US tour prove to be their last hoorah?This is a film that I've wanted to see for so long, but it was so rarely on TV that I never managed to catch it. Recently it was on BBC2 so I decided to give it a go and my feelings on the film are rather mixed...To start with the good; I thought the film was very well made and as host and filmmaker I thought Rob Reiner did a very good job - it's rare that you see him in front of the camera, but as it turns out unlike some directors he's not a bad actor. I also felt that the film offered a decent insight into life in a band and life on the road so to speak; although it's clearly an exaggeration and a spoof of rock bands and the rock band scene it all comes across quite convincingly and believable. I could well believe that musicians, managers, promoters etc would have some of the squabbles and issues that are depicted in the film. In fact, this is where the film is at its best; the backstage stuff, the interviews and so on are the more interesting aspects of the film. There were a couple of funny moments such as the artificial limb scene at the airport and the stonehenge debacle.The downside of the film for me lay with some of the characters; although some of what they say and do can be of interest they're all a bit thinly drawn and many claim that this film is an hilarious spoof of the rock n roll scene. Personally I would categorise this film as being a mildly amusing film, but certainly not a laugh out loud spoof. I also hoped I'd get more from the actual music side of the film, but even the songs weren't all that memorable - then again as its meant to be a spoof maybe that was the point.Although the main stars did a solid job I just wish that they'd have had a bit more about them; when watching films I like characters with something about them, somebody who you can understand, identify with and I just didn't get much of that here.This is Spinal Tap is an interesting insight into the rock n roll music scene (albeit an exaggerated offering) and for this reason it is worth seeing - particularly if you are a fan of the genre of music which is being spoofed. However, its best to keep your expectations low and ignore all the hype surrounding the film. That way, at least, you should find the film to be moderately enjoyable.FUN FACT; this film is apparently the only film on IMDB to have a rating out of 11.",17 September 2023

Billy Crystal plays Mike Wazowski, his witty, one-eyed best friend. Both of these monsters live in Monstropolis, a world where monsters roam freely. Their city is powered by children's screams.

""Monsters, Inc."" is one of the most enjoyable animated films I have ever had the pleasure of viewing.

What Pixar is doing today is just a continuation of the low quality storytelling that has plagued them since this movie, which is their fourth overall and third original.This movie feels like the notes for the ideas were used as the shooting script. It starts off explaining the premise in a training scenario, and what follows feels too audience-aware. You see the main duo in their morning routine and walking to work, which establishes the monster world -- again the movie explaining itself uncreatively.All the slapstick throughout is like Looney Tunes, and not up to Pixar or Disney's standard. The movie relies on it as the main source of comedy. That and the characters making stupid decisions. The characters here are just not earned. The audience is not given the chance to make heads or tails of them, you're just kind of thrown into this premise that doesn't go any farther than ""John Goodman and Billy Crystal as monsters running around being silly.""You see how the corporation responds to a single article of clothing as a contaminant, so what are they going to do to a human? The implications are disturbing at worst and not well thought out at best. A lot of movies don't have conventional plots, which can be appealing sometimes, but this one REALLY has no plot.You get explanatory exposition and then the rest is just characters running around and some emotionally-manipulative nonsense thrown in towards the end when it's time for the little girl to go home. It's all so tiresome and paint-by-the-numbers, and the way the outcome influences the company's change in operation is just stupid. Any child would still be scared to death by a monster entering their room, even if they were there to fall down. (I'm telling you -- they really go all in on slapstick.)This probably would have been more effective and interesting if it had been done with a more supernatural sensibility. It just doesn't make sense and you don't even get to see much of the monster's world/a variety of locations. They created a world so we could see three locations that resemble real life (a factory, an apartment and a restaurant.)It all feels so small and rushed. Skip it.",4 October 2023

",10,"""Rocketry: The Nambi Effect"" takes audiences on an enthralling journey through the extraordinary life of Dr. Nambi Narayanan, a brilliant Indian scientist whose story is both inspiring and deeply poignant. Directed by and starring R. Madhavan, the film not only delves into the scientific achievements of Dr. Narayanan but also explores the personal and political challenges he faced.At its core, ""Rocketry"" is a biographical drama that sheds light on India's space program and Dr. Nambi Narayanan's pivotal role in it. The narrative unfolds through a series of flashbacks as Dr. Narayanan recounts his experiences to a journalist. This storytelling device effectively captures the audience's attention, creating a sense of suspense and curiosity.Madhavan's portrayal of Dr. Nambi Narayanan is nothing short of stellar. He seamlessly captures the scientist's passion for space exploration, his unwavering commitment to his work, and the emotional toll of the false espionage charges leveled against him. The actor not only embodies the physicality of the character but also brings depth to the emotional nuances, making Dr. Narayanan a relatable and sympathetic figure.The film's cinematography deserves special mention. The visuals are breathtaking, especially when showcasing the intricacies of space research and the launches that marked India's space odyssey. The filmmakers successfully balance the grandeur of these moments with the intimacy required to tell Dr. Narayanan's personal story. The camera work effectively immerses the audience in the high-stakes world of space exploration while also allowing for quieter, introspective moments.One of the film's strengths lies in its ability to tackle complex scientific concepts without overwhelming the audience. The screenplay navigates the intricacies of rocket science and space missions with clarity, ensuring that even viewers unfamiliar with the technical details can follow and appreciate the narrative. This balance between scientific exposition and human drama is a testament to the filmmakers' commitment to both educating and entertaining.""Rocketry"" also serves as a commentary on the socio-political landscape of its time. The film addresses the dark period in Dr. Narayanan's life when he was falsely accused of espionage and subjected to a harrowing legal battle. The screenplay doesn't shy away from exposing the systemic flaws that led to his wrongful arrest and the impact it had on his personal and professional life. In doing so, it becomes a powerful commentary on the abuse of power and the resilience of the human spirit.The supporting cast, including Simran as Meena Narayanan, complements Madhavan's performance, adding emotional depth to the narrative. The chemistry between the characters is palpable, making the familial moments as impactful as the scientific achievements depicted in the film. The inclusion of personal anecdotes and interactions humanizes the characters, making them more than mere historical figures.While ""Rocketry"" excels in many aspects, it is not without its flaws. The pacing, especially in the second act, occasionally falters as the film juggles between the scientific and personal dimensions of Dr. Narayanan's life. Some scenes feel rushed, leaving certain character developments underexplored. However, these minor drawbacks do not significantly detract from the overall impact of the film.In conclusion, ""Rocketry: The Nambi Effect"" is a triumph on multiple fronts. It seamlessly weaves together the personal and professional aspects of Dr. Nambi Narayanan's life, creating a compelling narrative that educates and inspires. Madhavan's performance, coupled with outstanding cinematography and a well-crafted screenplay, elevates the film to a level of cinematic excellence. ""Rocketry"" stands not only as a tribute to a remarkable scientist but also as a testament to the indomitable human spirit in the face of adversity. It is a must-watch for those fascinated by space exploration, human resilience, and the untold stories of unsung heroes in the annals of science.",29 November 2023

I have this on DVD and it's not a bad looking film, I don't think it's as good though as My Darling Clementine with it's black and white cinematography, the great climax and Henry Fonda in the lead role. This is more of an ensemble piece. I wasn't really convinced by Kurt Russel in the main role, I think everyone agrees Val Kilmer stole the show. The Plot is a fairly familiar one with cowboys riding around killing people and spreading fear and chaos whether they go. The film has probably too many characters, to the point where you don't really know who the clear main villain is meant to be. The female characters are given a bit to do but I think the female characters are bit too modern. The film does some stuff well by build up the stakes, the dialogue though towards the end gets really bad and the film seems to have about 4 different endings. It's all action in the second half but it goes on too long and you loose track of who is who and what they want. The Kurt Russell portrayal of the character is just a madman by the end too who kills about 40 people, the Henry Fonda portrayal was much better, mature, authoritative but with a cold deadly streak running through him too. Some of the special effects are a bit overdone too, there's a storm in which lightening flashes about every 3 seconds for about 5 minutes which just doesn't happen. The music is decent but again not memorable. The costumes and editing are both fine, nothing distracting and all pretty nicely done.I definitely rate My Darling Clementine though over this.",27 December 2023

",6,"The director Billy Wilder once quipped 'I've seen Paris, France, and I've seen Paris, Hollywood, and frankly I prefer Paris, Hollywood'. Many of us have seen the West in documentary photos and the West in Tinseltown Westerns, and frankly the Tinseltown West gets most people's vote despite the violence and, well, the violence.I say that because just for watching Tombstone (for the second time in 30 years) I've been watching short 'What the West was really like' videos on YouTube, consisting of a great many contemporary photographs as well as information that usually doesn't come our way in courtesy of Tinseltown Western.The Westerns don't tell us of the choleras and tuberculosis epidemic, the horrific of sanitation, the often quite lethal medical 'care' at the hands of and the very, very basic bars. In those photos the women folk are often haggard and are not done up to the nines like the lass who fell for Shane, the men dress just just like the folk back East but are a lot shabbierThey were most certainly not done up to the nines with spotless shirts and jackets and bowler hats and the 'baddies' most certainly did not do themselves up with jingle-jangle and picturesque outfit. Gunfights were very rare indeed, as were bank robberies.The town's building were very often very basic jerry-built wooden death traps thrown up over night. The barroom were equally basic, their floors covered with straw to soak up spilled booze but also the phelgm drinkers spat out on the floor, ignoring the spittoons. Along the bar hung a number of towels which everyone used to wipe beer foam from their mouth and which were a major factor in spreading disease and infection.All that and more is why we prefer 'the West', Hollywood, to the rather dispirting real thing. The closest I have seen the fictional West come to what I now know was the real thing was on HBO's Deadwood. And that is also why the second time around my enjoyment and appreciation of Tombstone was decidedly muted. The world Tombstone is 1oo% fantasy. Oh, well.Having said that, fantasy and a make-believe past is exactly what the punters want when the buy their movie tickets and stock up on popcorn to wait for the lights to go out.

Cosmatos, but reportedly mostly by Kurt Russell, behind the scenes shenanigans aside, Tombstone skillfully captures the serious tone of the genre, retelling classics like 'OK Corral' and 'Hour of the Gun' with more weight. Kevin Jarre's writing takes historical liberties combined with dramatic storytelling, and William A. Fraker's cinematography immerses viewers in the tumultuous world of the Old West.The standout feature of Tombstone is its stellar ensemble cast, including standout performances by Michael Biehn and Powers Boothe. With some superb staging and setups Kurt Russell's Wyatt Earp and Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday are unforgettable, with Kilmer's performance deserving of an Oscar. Their on-screen chemistry adds depth and emotion to the film, while the supporting cast, including the likes of Sam Elliott as Virgil and Bill Paxton as Morgan, further enriches the story, making Tombstone a character-driven masterpiece. There are also a number of familiar faces like Stephen Lang, Jason Priestley, Michael Rooker, Billy Zane, and Charlton Heston, to name a few.Overall, Tombstone remains a must-see for fans of Westerns, anchored by remarkable performances from its cast.

The film is based on a true story that centers around the Earp brothers, Doc Holliday, and the cowboys of Cochise County. If you're looking for a film that includes drama, violence,and action this film incorporates all these elements. The film was directed by George P. Cosmatos and Kevin Jarre is a very thrilling western styled movie with all elements of such. While watching the film I was very intrigued from the beginning and from there the movie only got better, the casting of this film gives it the final touch of realism. The cast of the movie played a huge role in the making, production, and enjoyment of the film. Kurt Russel(Wyatt Earp), Val Kilmer(Doc Holliday), Sam Elliot(Virgiol Earp), Bill Paxton(Morgan Earp), Powers Boothe(Curly Bill Brocius), and Micheal Biehn(Johnny Ringo) played the lead roles and did a magnificent job. The movie felt almost as if you have been sucked into their world entirely. The film incorporated many fight scenes and monologues that made the film even more interesting.Even though the movie is an old film it still has a place in many hearts for many. The film has been one to remember, it's emotional, thrilling, overwhelming,and has many emotions that'll have you on the edge of your seat waiting for what's ever to come. While watching the movie you are faced with many different feelings each with their own opinion. Many people have seen this movie but not many have really dug deep into the deeper meaning of this film, the film can have a different meaning to different people. That is what makes this movie a classic film with great themes, one being that the power of love can affect someone's action. This is shown when one of Wyatt's good friends is killed, he then makes it his duty to kill any cowboys in the town. He was pushed into a killing spree of cowboys. The movie isn't like any other movie to be aired in the world, the movie shows what life was like in the earlier days. The history of this film dates back to the cowboy era in 1880's. The film is historically accurate and includes hints of humor to lighten the mood. In the movie everyone feared the cowboys and that is what gives the movie the entertainment element it has. A film like this is only made once in a lifetime, and the way the film was portrayed was very good. When I watched the film I felt I was watching something made for A-listers. The quality of the film was great, and had great entertainment values.I would recommend this film to anyone who is interested in the early 1880's and its cowboy era. The film was great and had very amazing scenes. My personal favorite character was Doc Holliday(Val Kilmer) . He is what many would call a drunk, but he is an amazing character dedicated to his friends and was a very comical character and I enjoyed watching any scenes he was included in. He was the one character that was able to lighten the mood in any scene. In the film he was very up-beat and was just a generally joking kind of person.

While the psychology of the characters is true to life (until the awkward ending), and there's a satirical aspect to the character of Don that I can laugh at, and appreciate, The film just isn't enough. In the film, you strictly follow Don in a way that is almost frustrating. I must praise the fact that Wilder attempted to mix up the storyline a bit through the usage of flashbacks, Don's fall in the stairs that caused a lapse in consciousness, and his hallucinations, but it doesn't suffice. Im not against minimalism in any sense, as many great works spanning many different forms of literature have been influenced by it. Alfred Hitchcock pulled it off brilliantly with his film Rear Window (as ""Jeff,"" is strictly confined to his apartment), and Wilder's magnum opus, Sunset Boulevard uses the idea of minimalism much more successfully.

",4,"Billy Wilder's ""The Lost Weekend"" clinching the Best Picture Oscar in 1945 must have been the result of some weak competition, or perhaps a committee intoxicated by something stronger than the protagonist, Don Birnam's drink of choice.The narrative, devoid of any meaningful external conflict, fixates on the monotonous descent into alcoholic chaos by the hapless writer Don Birnam, portrayed by Ray Milland, who snagged a Best Actor Oscar for his troubles.Don, sans job, survives on the benevolence of his brother, Wick (Phillip Terry), whose futile attempts to curb Don's drinking provide the film's feeble external struggle. A missed opportunity, I dare say! A character juggling alcoholism and a job, with spillover effects wreaking havoc on a spouse, would have injected much-needed complexity.Enter Jane Wyman as Helen, Don's endlessly patient girlfriend. Her tolerance for Don's excessive indulgences feels more like a saintly act than a believable portrayal. A dash of domestic turbulence would have spiced up the concoction.Don's internal strife takes center stage, leaving the audience with a chronicle of his solitary nosedive. In the 1945 context, Don's desperate quest for a drink might have been shocking, but by today's standards, it's the tamest of tipples.Don's ""sickness"" is a series of mild hiccups: hiding a bottle by a string outside the window, pilfering money meant for the cleaning lady, and forgetting where he stashed his rye - hardly the stuff of jaw-dropping revelation.The film's flashback, belatedly introduced, unravels the genesis of Don and Helen's ill-fated union. A tryst born out of a cloakroom mix-up, with Don bailing on meeting Helen's parents, feels more forced than fateful.As Don's downward spiral continues, his misadventures take on a more tragically absurd tone. Kicked out of a nightclub for not settling his bill, he later saunters down Third Avenue in NYC on a desperate odyssey to pawn his typewriter on Yom Kippur, conveniently forgetting that pawn shops are closed on the sacred day. This journey, coupled with his subsequent attempt to strong-arm a liquor store owner into gifting him a bottle, showcases a level of desperation that would make even the most seasoned barfly raise an eyebrow.The film's second act dark moment unfolds within the alcohol ward at Bellevue Hospital, offering a melodramatic tableau of patients in the throes of delirium tremens. Wilder pulls out all the stops in depicting the harrowing effects of alcoholism, but the result is more theatrical than authentic. It's a descent into a caricatured portrayal of suffering, complete with exaggerated tremors and fevered hallucinations. While it aims for intensity, the execution feels more like a maudlin stage production than a nuanced exploration of the horrors of addiction. In this descent into the abyss, ""The Lost Weekend"" strays perilously close to losing its grip on the fine line between drama and melodrama.The climax, where Helen miraculously talks Don out of suicide after he procures a firearm from a pawn shop, is as believable as a unicorn sighting. After witnessing Don's colossal addiction, the abrupt turnaround is cinematic malpractice.Ray Milland's one-note performance as Don is commendable, sprinkled with occasional self-reflective poetry. On the flip side, Jane Wyman is shackled with a goody-two-shoes role that fails to convince.Miklos Rosla's theremin-laden score may have aimed for intense drama, but it feels more like a soundtrack to a sci-fi escapade. In a film about the perils of alcoholism, the theremin's eerie tones transport us to another dimension, far from the gritty reality Wilder intended.In the end, ""The Lost Weekend"" feels more like a meandering stroll through mild inebriation than an intoxicating exploration of the demons within. If this is the best picture of 1945, then perhaps sobriety has its merits after all.",20 December 2023

Wilder's film dramatically changed that perception forever by showing audiences what alcoholism truly was: a serious and debilitating illness.Returning by train from Chicago to Los Angeles, Wilder read ""The Lost Weekend"", which he'd just purchased from the bookstore at the Windy City's La Salle depot. Before reaching Union Station in Los Angeles, Wilder knew it had the potential to become a powerful motion picture. His primary inspiration for navigating into this uncharted territory was legendary crime novelist Raymond Chandler. Wilder's collaboration with the hard drinking Chandler on DOUBLE INDEMNITY was a miserable experience for him, and he saw THE LOST WEEKEND as a way of exploring the taboo topic of alcoholism in more context.Paramount Pictures, whom Wilder was under contract to, was initially reluctant to make THE LOST WEEKEND due to its somber subject matter. But the director just handed them a hit with DOUBLE INDEMNITY, another movie they had cold feet about, and therefore decided to trust his instincts. To the studio's credit, they loyally stuck by Wilder's side when they became aware of the liquor industry's vehement hostility to the book and movie, even going so far as to turn down a handsome offer from them to burn the original negative.To play the protagonist Don Birnham, Wilder wanted stage actor Jose Ferrer. But because Ferrer was a then-unknown commodity in Hollywood, Paramount countered by insisting on contract player Ray Milland, a leading man of mostly light romantic comedies. Well aware of the risk his employers were taking with the project, Wilder acquiesced to them without protest. In private life, the Welsh born Milland was no more than a casual drinker, but he nervously threw himself into the challenging part with the studiousness of a Method actor, shedding about twenty pounds and restricting his food consumption. His disheveled appearance was so convincing that, when the cast and crew was shooting on location in New York, he was spotted by one of his wife's friends, who worriedly contacted her back in Hollywood out of concern for his well-being.Don Birnham is an alcoholic would-be writer sharing his apartment with brother Wick. Like many dipsos, Don is ashamed of his addiction, yet feels powerless to overcome it. Therefore, he resorts to extraordinary lengths to conceal the evidence of his dissipation from the people who love him. If it wasn't for Wick and Don's girlfriend Helen St James (Jane Wyman), he would have been destitute and homeless ~or worse, dead~ a long time ago.The Birnham brothers are preparing to leave New York for a long weekend at their parents' home in the country. Don has a bottle hidden away from prying eyes outside the window sill, but is unable to retrieve it without Wick noticing. An opportunity arises when Helen arrives with two tickets for a concert that evening. Don suggests that she and Wick go instead, after which the siblings will simply take a later train for their planned vacation. But Don's scheme is foiled when his brother happens to spot the bottle, to which he feigns ignorance, claiming it was placed there during one of his benders and, therefore, he must've forgotten about it.Helen and Wick have departed for the concert, but Don now has no booze and no money. Luckily for him, he finds $10 ~worth $170 today~ stashed away for the cleaning lady, and promptly heads to the liquor store for two bottles of rye, followed by a visit to his favorite watering hole: Nat's Bar. Don's plan is to limit the amount consumed before rejoining his brother in two hours. But one shot glass soon turns into five, which Wilder cleverly illustrates by using the images of liquid rings left on the countertop by each glass. It could almost pass for the Olympic logo. Unsurprisingly, Don fails to make it back to the apartment before Wick and Helen.Totally fed up with having to constantly nurse his intoxicated sibling, Wick angrily leaves for the country without him. It's now incumbent upon Helen to look after her boyfriend, who, by this point, is too embarrassed to face her. Once Don is able to sneak back into the apartment, he hides one of his two bottles in a clever place ~too clever, as it turns out~ and then drinks himself into unconsciousness with the other.Waking up the next morning, the first thing Don does to alleviate his hangover is to set off to Nat's for his hair of the dog. The proprietor, by this time, is tired of not only feeding his customer's addiction but also his neglecting Helen. This is where we learn through a series of flashbacks how she and Don met, and her eventual discovery of his alcoholism. Nat inadvertently inspires the Hemingway wannabe to channel his excess onto paper, where Don immediately proceeds back home to begin. Sitting in front of his typewriter, he can only get as far as the title ""The Bottle. A novel by Don Birnham"".With the writer's block setting in much earlier than he expected, Don unsuccessfully searches for that second rye bottle he stashed in a place so ingenious that even he can't remember. After tearing his suite apart in vain, Birnham seeks creative stimulation by roaming the Big Apple in search of the next drink, culminating in a weekend of humiliating and harrowing episodes.The critics were unanimous in their praise for every facet of THE LOST WEEKEND, whether it be the directing, acting, writing, photography, or music score. Milland's commitment to his character's illness, from his slight frame to sweaty dishevelment, netted him the best reviews of his life. Insofar as composer Miklôs Rozsa's score, there's an interesting note of trivia: THE LOST WEEKEND was the first motion picture to make use of the theremin, a wavy-sounding electronic instrument subsequently adopted as a musical motif in many a sci-fi, including Star Trek. In WEEKEND, Wilder and Rozsa cannily used the theremin during the sequences where Birnham's delirium is overwhelming, thus augmenting Milland's convincing performance.Arriving in theaters after VE and Days, THE LOST WEEKEND was the equivalent of a cold water splash into audiences' faces. The scenes from THE LOST WEEKEND that truly encapsulated the horror of substance withdrawal were the ones set in, and filmed at, Bellevue's alcoholic ward. After Don's binges ultimately land him there, we bear witness to the nighttime hallucinations of a repeat ""visitor"", who reacts violently towards imaginary insects crawling all over him. It remains jolting nearly eight decades later!!The Academy atoned for their sin of bypassing Wilder's DOUBLE INDEMNITY the previous year by acknowledging THE LOST WEEKEND this time around. It was awarded four Oscars: Best Picture, Director, Screenplay, and Actor for Milland. The accolades extended beyond Hollywood; the New York Film Critics Circle bestowed those same honors to THE LOST WEEKEND. When the Cannes Festival was inaugurated immediately following the war, it was among eleven international features to share the top prize, with other winners being Roberto Rossellini's OPEN CITY and David Lean's BRIEF ENCOUNTER.

There are so many victims whose price is greater than that of the drinker, whose lives have been screwed up because of the trust and betrayal.

By the way, anyone who thinks the final scene is a positive one, with the girl with the smile and the hopefulness. I see it as absolutely meaningless, manipulative, and close ended.

",6,"The Lost Weekend is, doubtless, an unrelenting, powerful film which details the effects of alcohol strikingly. This is helped by Ray Millands towering, Oscar winning performance, playing an alcoholic who feels vividly realistic. It also does not fall into stereotyping alcoholics, lending a degree of empathy to our alcoholic main character. Millands Don is portrayed as a man who turns to the bottle because of insecurities regarding his talent and career as a writer. When he is sober and lucid, we has a dry wit typical of characters in Billy Wilder movies. He is intelligent, worldly, and cultured. But all that becomes naught when he starts drinking, when he becomes a pathetic, spineless creature, doing anything to make sure he secures another drink. Millands performance is extraordinary and it is no wonder the academy voted him the award for best actor. Jane Wyman is also good as Helen, his unconditionally loving girlfriend who helps him get sober in the end. My probe, with the lost weekend is that it is a film of raw, unpolished impact- it certainly is a powerful film, bound to persuade any aspiring alcoholics to steer clear of over indulging. But for sober people, the film may lack any new insight into drinking. The film, for most of its runtime, shows Don drinking and wanting another drink afterwards. It may be brutally realistic for its time, but when judged by modern day standards, it may lack any new intellectual discovery into what motivates alcoholic to drink and continue drinking, and further elaboration on its impacts. It seems the entire strength on The Lost Weekend lies on Ray Millands commanding performance- the best of his career.",6 June 2023

",9,"The Lost Weekend, known for being one of the only films to win both ""Best Picture"" at the Oscars and the ""Palme D'or"" at Cannes, is a film about a debaucherous down-spiral into alcoholism. The characters begin in reputable social standings and have good lives, with nothing out of the ordinary wrong, other than wanting a drink.This, though, turns into quite the disaster, and perhaps this film is a fair warning about alcoholism, with people in high standings and comfortable, stable lives descending into degeneracy and disaster.It is sad that this happens, as the characters are very like-able, the kind of people you'd like to get to know and be friends with. You feel no ill will towards them and want them to succeed, though they struggle.Alcoholism would obviously require some special Mise-en-scène and other film techniques - dreamy cinematography, to match the drunken states of the characters, which is done well in this film.Don Birnam, the alcoholic in question, is a likable writer, who unfortunately seems to botch many social obligations because of his cravings, alienating his friends in the process and failing to follow through on many plans. He generates further into physical symptoms and ends up in a ward. After a suicide attempt, he agrees to write a book about his struggles.Perhaps here, alcohol and alcoholism represents the precariousness and uncertainty of life, that success and stability can turn into failure and regret rather quickly. A lethal tightrope.The damage alcohol can cause is perhaps milder in this film than in more recent ones about substance abuse and addiction (A film from 1945 can only show so much), though it is still a sad spectacle. Maybe a more subtle sadness creates more of an impact though. Simple, utter failure instead of wild carnage.

A boy puts together a band to impress a girl who he invites to be in his music video (there was no band when asked her). That setup may sound like a rather conventional teen comedy but this 1980s Dublin set story has a heart to it that you rarely get in most teen comedies. It's from writer/director John Carney, creator of the fantastic Amazon anthology series MODERN LOVE and the equally great films BEGIN AGAIN and ONCE. What I love about Carney's work is that he tells stories that manage to feel whimsical yet rawly realistic. His story pitches must sound completely conventional, but his careful balance of realism and movie artifice makes his films feel unique. I also love how music always plays an integral role in all of his films. With a story about a group of kids putting together a band in 1985 offers Carney the perfect opportunity to put some classic 80s tunes on the soundtrack and for the band to create their original songs riffing on everything from Duran Duran to The Cure. Featuring a cast of immensely talented unknown teens (particularly Ferdia Walsh-Peelo as the boy leading the band and Lucy Boynton as the girl he's trying to impress), and with some familiar adult actors (Maria Doyle Kennedy from ORPHAN BLACK and Aidan Gillen from GAME OF THRONES as the boy's mom and dad, and Jack Reynor from MIDSOMMAR and some TRANSFORMERS movie as the ""wise"" older brother who is full of advice on both girls and music), the cast is utterly perfect.

The scenery is hostile but nonetheless gorgeous in typical Western fashion. It's so well done you feel you'll start freezing at any moment. The opening scene already sets the tone: erratic characters, suspicion, secrets, dirty mouths and of course a gunfight is always round the corner.By the way, style over substance is a common criticism regarding Tarantino's work and while it's true The Hateful Eight is dazzlingly stylish, this doesn't detract from the story - quite the contrary, it makes for even more compelling storytelling. There are very few moments where the Tarantino touch would qualify as over the top or unnecessary.One defining feature of the movie is that more or less in its entirety takes place in one room, a risky choice on paper, which definitely works here, as it creates interesting dynamics between this group of seemingly random characters who are busy trying to survive the frost and solve an Agatha Christie type of mystery. It's fascinating watching the tension reach a boiliing point, a bloodbath waiting to happen.Every character has an interesting background on his own, but it's the interactions between them that elevate the movie to the next level. This is achieved mostly through dialogue, one of the movie's highlights. Punchlines are fyling left and right, people start ranting and raving out of nowhere, while the occasional socio-political commentary adds another element. There are also non-verbal details, amplified by the fabulous cast. Even though it's hard to sympathise with any of them - they are hateful, indeed - they are presented in a three dimensional way that invites you to see their point of view and try to understand their state of mind and guess their motives.Ennio Morricone delivers as usual, though the music is not one the first things that stand out, one could argue his presence is rather thin.The movie totally justifies its relatively long running time, as it flows effortlessly and doesn't drag at any point.",27 December 2023

It's now December, which is the start of summer in the Southern Hemisphere. I don't feel like I'm doing The Hateful Eight many favors by watching it while the weather's warm.I'm not sure I can add much to what other people say about The Hateful Eight, because I generally agree with the general consensus. It is not nearly one of his best films, but it's still packed with great dialogue, some incredibly strong acting, and beautiful/distinctive visuals mixed with an excellent Ennio Morricone score that finally got him the Oscar win he should've gotten like, 50 years earlier, for one of the Sergio Leone Westerns.Something that I do feel has impacted the 2010s era (and perhaps beyond) of Tarantino's filmography is the loss of Sally Menke. She edited movies of his that were long and sometimes patiently paced (Pulp Fiction and especially Jackie Brown - both of which were over 2.5 hours), but things felt more purposeful and tighter. She was someone who was able to tell Tarantino no, it seemed, but she didn't tell him no just to get a kick out of things. She told him no when he was unable to realize, and he seemed to listen. Just about every movie of his she edited has perfect pacing. Django Unchained, The Hateful Eight, and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood... I really like all these movies, but each feels about 15 minutes too long and all run the risk of feeling a tiny bit dragged down in places.Because everything else outside the editing works, these three most recent Tarantino films are still a blast. I've seen Django Unchained three times I think, Hateful Eight three times, and I know I saw Once Upon a Time in Hollywood twice in cinemas. I really like these films, but I don't love them.I also thought I might complain about how mean The Hateful Eight is, but that's totally the point. It's in the title, and the film is Tarantino deliberately pushing things far and having a whole cast full of jerks just abuse, taunt, and eventually kill each other. Subjectively, I can say I like it when some of his characters have a little heart (Jules realizing the errors of his ways in Pulp Fiction, the motherly instincts of The Bride in Kill Bill, the genuinely sweet connection between Pam Grier and Robert Forster's characters in the surprisingly heartfelt Jackie Brown), but that's just me. Objectively, Tarantino made a movie called The Hateful Eight, and at least eight of these characters were crazy hateful.

However, The Hateful Eight is far from a masterpiece, and not even a fully fitting musical score from the very best can make Tarantino's study of western clichés, and his signature hyper violent final into a great film.

Now, when I was looking into this movie, specifically about the plot, I went in expecting this to be full of dark and depressing moments. You'd be surprised to find that actually this movie is very funny in places and more light than dark.With great supporting actors that appear in quite a lot of Clint's movies, I was delighted to find that Clint didn't carry the whole of the movie. There are quite a few characters from Josey Wales that will stick to you when this movie is over.The soundtrack was Oscar worthy, thumbs up to Jerry Fielding for his splendid military drums and wholesome sounds. Though, I believe that they should have at least considered Ennio Morricone for the music, as nothing E. M does becomes uninteresting.While hard to grasp what is going on at first, the plot soon folds out and becomes easy going and never ends up boring you throughout the whole run time.As a result this movie certainly appeals more to me than Pale Rider, or even the Spaghetti Westerns at times. It really proves that Clint Eastwood can maintain the 'cowboyness' of his persona no matter what the age is, and can certainly direct a good solid movie too.

If you consider that problematic, this movie isn't for you.For those who love adventure and laughs, this is one tough guy flick.Josey's entire family had just been murdered, due to entitlements created by the end of the Civil War. Union soldiers would pillage small southern towns, as their way of reaping their rewards.When a band of Confederate rabble rousers led by Fletcher (John Vernon) make a truce with the Union, they are ambushed which leaves Josey on the run.What I absolutely love about this movie is that Clint Eastwood doesn't budge from his tough guy personae. While his wife and kids are murdered. Or when his friends are murdered, the call to arms is always in his wheelhouse.Beaten, bruised and tired, he is on the run. Whilst bounty hunters are searching for him, they understand that his well-earned legend puts them really in the crosshairs.This is a rough guy movie.

",6,"The Outlaw Josey Wales (1) (1976) -My US history is a bit rusty so I was a bit unsure, but I thought that Clint Eastwood's character, Josey Wales, was on the racist side of the Civil War, the one that liked slavery? This confused me, when he then made friends with the Native American, Lone Watie, cleverly played by Chief Dan George.Overall Clint's character just seemed to be trying to get revenge for his wife and son's murder, without a specific agenda either way for the war, but as a soldier on what I thought was the losing side, that part of the story seemed to need a bit of clarity. Maybe his relationship with Lone Watie would have been a more extraordinary thing if I'd known what Josey's political views really were and what being a ""Red Leg"" meant.All in all, the film was definitely too long and there were many points where it could have been wrapped up, but it was one of the better put together westerns that I've seen.I felt that it bore some resemblances to 'Dances With Wolves' (1990), with a couple of hints of 'Django Unchained' (2012) too and what I liked about it was that it did at least seem like a realistic interpretation of the Wild West as much as I am aware of it. It wasn't played for comedy or romance, but delivered as a straight up 'This was what it was like', depiction, not always pleasant, but factual regardless.I've never been Clint's biggest fan though. I just can't understand why he has ever been so popular. He delivered another enigmatic cowboy who kept his cards close to his chest and gave very little about himself away, but even in 1976 there were other actors that could have given a much broader and more charismatic performance of Josey. And did he have to spit all the way through the film?As for his missus, Sondra Locke playing Laura Lee was dead weird. I couldn't tell if she was supposed to be such a bubble head or whether that was just the actor in the role.And the film really didn't need her character at all. In fact it could have ended with a shoot out just before she even appeared on the scene and the story would have been just as interesting.I thought that it might have been better if she'd been a young child instead, even a boy perhaps, that way it could have avoided the crappy romance bit.Other than that I noted that the horses appeared to get a rough treatment throughout. I hoped that they were stunt horses and well paid for their performances.It was probably one act too long and there was certainly places that it could have been trimmed down otherwise, but it was well produced and the story was sound, if a little bit muddied at times. It won't be one that I will hurry back to, but I could see that it would have appealed to bigger fans of the cowboy (Cowperson) and western genre.610.19/1000.",14 June 2023

Whilst I've not watched that many of Clints westerns, I've seen enough to know he usually plays a brooding individual with a reason for revenge and this film is no different. The villains are evil, perform some pretty heinous acts, at different stages of the film, and make you route for Clint (Josey) when he sets about them. In having to become an outlaw to survive he assembles a motley crew on his travels as he rescues individuals in the various perils he encounters. The film works because the villains are so unpleasant, whilst the people who's aid Josey comes to are all likeable, at least to some degree or other, so you inevitably care what happens to them and Josey, which is really what all good stories should make you do. It's not rocket science but it's well directed, the cinematography is great and the relationship between Josey and particularly Lone Waite in his crew is a joy to watch. For those of you who want your shoot outs to be realistic then no doubt you'll be critical, Josey shouldn't make it past the first shoot out or the second or third for that matter.

",9,"This film is based on two preposterous ideas. First is the idea that a late-20th century classical composer could be world renowned for writing tonal music that sounds like Berlioz. Second is the idea that any man would cheat on Juliette Binoche. Clearly this film is intended as fantasy, or magical realism.In all seriousness, this is a thought provoking movie about how one can respond to tragedy. Julie's first instinct after the sudden death of her husband and child is to attempt suicide. Her second instinct is to sell her possessions, move to the big city and live without attachments. But she keeps being pulled back into her past, in part by a fragment of music that she keeps hearing in her head.The film leaves several questions unresolved and invites the viewer to speculate. Here is my theory: Julie is indeed the true composer of her husband's works, including the unfinished ""Concerto for a United Europe"". Her husband's death leaves her in a terrible position--either she must stop composing, to maintain the fiction that her husband was a great man, or she must reveal the truth.At first she tries the former--she throws away the manuscript to the old concerto and hides from her husband's assistant (who knows the truth and has secretly loved Julie for years). But the music keeps ringing in her head, demanding to be finished and shared with the world.The story turns when Julie discovers that her husband was unfaithful and that his mistress is carrying his child This discovery liberates Julie from the need to protect her husband's reputation and allows her to resume composing without guilt. She finishes the concerto and by the end of the film is ready to claim ownership, to take her rightful place in the world.",11 October 2023

It starts off well with an interesting premise but as I was already familiar with the director's style, I thus sensed the pace of the film in the forthcoming hour, wherein I felt my disinterest growing slowly as I was nearing the end.

rw9142159,ur25126113,tt0108394," I don't use the term pretentious lightly, but this movie qualifies as that
",6,"I will clarify that a lot of the issues I have with the film deal with it being a tired genre/concept: Depressed woman's (or man) life spirals out of control and they start destroying everything that they hold close along with manipulating men close to them to feel a sense of control. However, I think part of my bias against this genre is that I've seen a good number of films released AFTER 1993 that have this premise and I find it quite dull UNLESS it has something meaningful to say or poignant (however, this genre was also explored by many people beforehand, Bergman, Scorsese, Welles, and Tarkovsky being no exception)Things I like: The cinematography is pretty good, especially for a 90s movie as there was a slump in cinematography expertise during this time period, so I will say that it is a great looking film for the time. I think there are also a lot of little clever techniques used here and there, but nothing super out of the ordinary.Things I don't like or irritated me:1) That darn soundtrack blaring in randomly to make some sort of point behind the character's motivation: The movie frequently uses this motif where a character will ask Julie a personal question, melodramatic music will blare, scene cuts to black, wait 3-6 seconds, and then fade back into the scene and she responds to the question with a response that is generally ""no"". This isn't clever nor is it interesting. It's a bizarre gimmick that I don't think really works and only draws attention to itself as if to impress the audience with ""wow, did you see what we did there? We used an audio visual queue every time she evades the pains of her past"".To make matters worse, the soundtrack is finally completed by the end of the film and the lyrics are finally completed to visuals of: Julie having super uncomfortable sex with her friend, a stripper/prostitute (what is European cinema's obsession with the ""misunderstood"" prostitute trope) who looks like she is nervous to go on stage, and an ultrasound of Julie's husband's mistress' baby... with lyrics taken straight from 1 Corinthians 13:4-8 that have NOTHING to do with what is happening on screen unless you intentionally misinterpret the text itself to make it match what the movie wants them to mean. The implication is supposed to be the different kinds of love shown in the movie, but having that over scenes of a woman having super uncomfortable looking sex with her friend whom she manipulated and mentally abused is pretty dumb way to make any logical connection between the two. It comes across as rather immature and ignorant.2) It has the dumb trope of ""I'm going to befriend my husband's mistress because I feel responsible for her"" trope: I've seen this in multiple movies over the years, particularly in Europe, where there is this consistent lens of mistresses not being responsible for tearing apart relationships or causing issues. The movie immediately states that our main character shouldn't be mad at the mistress and one of the first lines from the mistress is ""You don't hate me, do you?"". Julie then immediately befriends the mistress, gives her all of her property (a giant mansion) and the mistress responds, ""I knew you would do this because your husband (who I slept with for years) told me you were a good person. You did the right thing giving me this mansion because you're a good person."" Excuse me, what? You BARELY even know this woman, she grants you a mansion FOR FREE and then you tell her that YOU KNEW she would do this? I think most people at that point would probably rescind the offer.3) As mentioned before hand, the ""Hooker with a heart of Gold"" trope: This is more of a personal bias, but I genuinely don't understand the disconnect a lot of directors have for this trope where they tend to intentionally ignore how bad the industry is for most women in it and that a lot of women are addicted to drugs or blackmailed to not leave said industry (as well the human-trafficking issues). There's a big difference between humanizing people that are victims of prostitution and simply painting it as ""it's a fun job that people choose that should be respected like any other job"". The prostitute in question (who apparently is making advances on other men in the apartment complex so much so that people are trying to kick her out) has a scene where she has a nervous breakdown because she sees her dad in the audience of one of her shows, but he is bored by what he sees. This ALMOST could've been the beginning of a really good and engaging scene, but it is then flatlined by it not being developed to a degree that truly makes it meaningful. I understand that the intent of the scene is to contrast Julie with Lucille (the two characters are lit in completely different lighting), where Julie is witnessing what a life without any restraints is like and questions why Lucille lives this lifestyle, but I wish we could've seen some sort of change in Lucille, even if only a little. The scene ends with Lucille being thankful that Julie showed up, saying she enjoys her lifestyle, and that she wishes her dad would've been kicked out of the club, yet hasn't gained any self-awareness of her dichotomy. I just don't understand the purpose of her character in the film if it doesn't really add to the meaning of the film itself. It just feels like a trope thrown in for the sake of it being there.All in all, not a terrible film, definitely well-made, but I find its themes, conclusion, and certain creative choices to be rather obnoxious and annoying.",23 June 2023
rw9078406,ur1964495,tt0108394," Fabulously absorbing and unquestionably brilliant
",10,"I've got to hand it to Krzysztof Kieslowski, this is immediately captivating and firmly holds one's attention. In his direction and every facet of the screenplay he penned with Krzysztof Piesiewicz, in Slawomir Idziak's active, dynamic, and mindful cinematography, and in Jacques Witta's brilliant editing there's a marginal tinge of fancifulness that quite seems to heavily accentuate the profound, aching emotional gravity of the story. That bent is further echoed in production design, art direction, and even lighting that pointedly weaves in hues of red, white, and especially (obviously) blue into each scene, if not every shot. At the same time, Kieslowski's direction, the cinematography, the hair and makeup, Zbigniew Preisner's flavorful and dramatic score, and above all Juliette Binoche's acting are all characterized by a barbed, brusque forcefulness that truly leans into harsh emphasis of Julie's anguished mental state. The latter quality is further reflected in rather brisk pacing, and all this is something that if not done right can quickly undo a picture, and has in many other instances. There's no doubt in my mind, however, that Kieslowski knew exactly what he as doing, and that complete, unwavering vision fully comes across with stark, powerful, undeniable impact. It's no wonder why 'Trois couleurs: Bleu' is so highly regarded, for it comes at us like a freight train and hits just as hard.It's difficult in the moment to drum up other examples of movies that go for the throat as much as this one does. Every aspect of the writing, and the feature's craft otherwise, is geared toward zeroing in on Julie's effort to isolate herself with her pain, and additional illustrations of suffering and hardship are woven in that she consciously tries to avoid. With her failure or inability to truly divorce herself from humanity - and in fact, growing attachments despite herself - there's a welcome measure of warm sincerity that shines through to counterbalance the more stringent facets of the proceedings. The push and pull of this struggle, Julie's attempted seclusion and the threads that draw her back in, is the bread and butter of this fierce drama, and it's realized with a delicate thoughtfulness that's all the more impressive for how it's hidden behind the veil of the ponderous, unequivocal execution. Furthermore, this is how it goes for most elements of the film, benefiting from sprightly skill and intelligence: Preisner's score, Witta's editing (not to mention discrete moments when music and cuts are ingeniously swirled together), the camerawork; the writing of dialogue, characters, scenes, and the story at large; every performance, though again Binoche readily stands out most. That echo of storytelling in the craftsmanship, and vice versa - light and inviting, versus dark or weighty and assertively stressed - is a master stroke of film-making like few other works have ever been able to achieve.Even with such great acclaim I didn't truly know what to expect when I sat to watch this; certainly there have been other instances of well regarded pictures that I belatedly checked out and found myself disappointed or put out. I feel safe in saying that 'Trois couleurs: Bleu' is fully deserving of its grand reputation, however. It's exquisitely well made from start to finish, with impeccable and carefully shaped contributions from all involved. Kieslowski should be well familiar to any cinephile on at least a nominal basis given the status his films are afforded, and one need not even see any others for this one to definitively prove why. Devilishly smart in how it's put together, fabulously absorbing in the narrative that it relates, and altogether spellbinding, this is without a doubt the type of feature that everyone needs to see at least once. It may not appeal equally to all, but it earns a blanket recommendation nonetheless; whether you make it your top priority or just make a note for a later time, 'Bleu' is a modern classic that's worth every terrific minute.",26 May 2023

That involves her taking herself deep into the anonymity of Paris - but she is soon to realise that her need for much desired isolation is not reciprocated by her friend who have no intention of letting her disappear under a rock. Things truly come to an head when she re-encounters old flame ""Olivier"" (Benoît Régent) and there might just be light at the end of her tunnel? It is quite an observational piece of work, this, and Binoche is well capable of demonstrating just how the trauma and drama of this incident and of her subsequent choices impacts on the character - a reaction that could resonate with many, I suspect. The dialogue is sparing and the pace of this rather potent depiction of grief and it's consequences moves in a measured fashion with no obvious conclusion to draw upon. The supporting cast do exactly that, they provide brief moments for us to recalibrate and adjust as ""Julie"" herself has to adapt, and though I could have been doing with just a little humour to relax the plot at times, it's still a great example of a well considered story and an actor at the top of her game.",16 May 2023

The ties of the past simply weigh down on her until she can no longer deny the bond between the Julie of the past and the Julie of the present, with the legacy of her husband's orchestra and unborn child determined to unite them into the future.

Blue now looks like a pastiche arthouse movie, populated by luminously beautiful women mooning around Parisian cafes and strip joints with cigarettes in their mouths, and nothing of any consequence happening.Juliette Binoche is undeniably fine in the lead, but this felt to me like a heterosexual 'male gaze' idealisation of a beautiful grieving woman who needed saving from her affectlessness, and without any amatory investment in her it was difficult for me to engage. The film has none of the intellectual provocation and interest of her work with Michael Haneke, which is much more my thing.The cinematography is gorgeous, and the few interesting moments are where the camera homes in on beautiful quotidian detail (a cube of sugar absorbing coffee, a leaking brake line, etc).",2 April 2023

",7,"The plot of A Beautiful Mind is relatively simple, as we follow a brilliant math student who climbs the academic ladder but also dives into the dark waters of mental illness.The way this story is told, though, elevates the movie to the next level. It's not easy to fit an entire lifespan in two hours, but the movie flows naturally and handles the various changes in mood (it jumps from comedy to romance to thriller to drama). Any trick or technique used isn't meant to show off, it feels like an organic part of the story. Another thing the movie achieves is offering us a glimpse of schizophrenia's effect on the human mind, making us question what's real and spreading a sense of doubt that can't be shaken off.However, all the above is secondary and the elephant in the room has to be addressed, namely the absolutely mesmerising performance delivered by Russell Crowe.Apart from the increasingly disturbing scenes that show the development of his state of mind, there are many other memorable scenes as well, for example his social awkwardness when flirting with a girl and informs her that intercourse is merely an exchange of body fluids, or his first date with Alicia where he creates any shape with the help of the star system and of course the scene where he receives the pens of his peers and with them their recognition.As it often happens with biographies, it isn't 100% accurate, there are some changes for dramatic effect. The most obvious example is probably his relationship with his wife, which was way bumpier than portrayed here and actually led to a divorce at some point. Also, the fact that his son suffers from similar issues could have been brought up, but the movie was fully invested in a feel-good ending, declaring love as the winner that overcomes any problem.",4 January 2024

",5,"Before ""A Beautiful Mind"" secured the Academy Award for Best Picture, it faced scrutiny for alleged omissions and misrepresentations in the portrayal of Nobel Prize-winning mathematician John Nash, played by Russell Crowe. Accusations ranged from ignoring Nash's purported anti-Semitic views to potential bisexuality, with critics questioning the accuracy of the film's depiction.The screenplay, penned by Akiva Goldsman and based on Sylvia Nasar's 1998 biography, aimed to defend Nash's character. Nasar contended that Nash's anti-Semitic remarks were made during psychotic episodes and not reflective of his true beliefs. There was no concrete evidence of homosexuality, Nash fathered a child prior to his marriage, experienced a divorce, and eventually remarried. These criticisms, I believe, lacked substantial evidence and unjustly aimed to discredit the film.However, ""A Beautiful Mind"" remains vulnerable to critique for its somewhat amateurish treatment of schizophrenia. The film's first third follows Nash's perspective without revealing his mental illness. It initially appears as though Nash is being recruited by the Department of Defense in the early 1950s, fresh out of Princeton and working as a lecturer at MIT. A shadowy government agent, Parcher (Ed Harris), enlists Nash to decipher encrypted Communist communications hidden within ordinary magazines.Doubts begin to arise about the authenticity of these events, especially during a car chase where Nash and Parcher are pursued by presumed Soviet agents. It gradually becomes evident that these are hallucinations, much to the anguish of Nash's devoted girlfriend and later wife, Alicia (Jennifer Connelly). She can only watch helplessly as Nash is committed to a mental institution under the care of psychiatrist Dr. Rosen (Christopher Plummer). There, he undergoes electroshock therapy and later receives medication after showing signs of improvement.The medication takes a toll on Nash's personal life, resulting in a loss of sexual desire and a diminished version of his former self. Nash decides to cease the medication, only for the hallucinations to return. Alicia finds that he has been enacting his illusory ""code breaking"" in the garage, plastering magazine clippings on the walls. In a horrifying incident, he leaves their newborn child in the bathtub, mistakenly believing that his visiting college roommate (another hallucination) was watching over the child.Alicia agrees to leave Nash and take the baby to her mother while Nash works through his troubles without medication. In real life, Nash opted not to continue with medication and gradually resumed teaching despite recurring hallucinations, which he learned to manage. However, the film deviates intentionally from this fact to avoid promoting the notion that treating schizophrenia without psychotropic medication is typical.The film concludes with the expected Hollywood ending: Nash overcomes his affliction and receives the Nobel Prize. While the Nobel Prize's significance is not lost on me, the film fails to elucidate why Nash's work was truly deserving of this honor. It simplistically promotes the notion of triumph over mental illness.In reality, Nash experienced auditory hallucinations, yet the film's writers chose a more visual approach. They opted for two recurring characters, which, though true to the script, do not capture the full complexity of schizophrenia, which typically involves a series of distressing and harrowing experiences.Crowe, while perhaps a touch too mature for the part of a young student, undergoes impressive makeup to age himself convincingly. Ron Howard does not shy away from depicting Nash's youthful arrogance or his subsequent redemption after grappling with mental illness. Jennifer Connelly portrays Alicia's strength in supporting Nash during his breakdown, but her role ultimately contributes to the overall hagiographical treatment. Christopher Plummer, a seasoned actor, delivers an excellent performance as Nash's tough yet compassionate psychiatrist.",5 November 2023

",9,"Schindler's List, directed by Steven Spielberg and released in 1993, is a cinematic masterpiece that stands as a hauntingly powerful testament to the Holocaust. Based on the true story of Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who saved the lives of more than a thousand Polish-Jewish refugees during World War II, the film is a heartbreaking and unforgettable portrayal of the Holocaust's horrors, human resilience, and one man's extraordinary act of compassion. Spanning over three hours, this black-and-white epic leaves an indelible mark on its viewers.The film's visual style, presented in stark black and white, evokes a sense of historical authenticity and a tone of somber reflection. The absence of color intensifies the raw emotions and stark realities the characters face. Spielberg's decision to shoot the film in this manner creates a harrowing and visceral experience that immerses the audience in the bleakness of the Holocaust era.The casting of Schindler's List is exceptional, with Liam Neeson delivering a remarkable performance as Oskar Schindler. Neeson portrays Schindler as a complex character, a charming and opportunistic businessman who undergoes a profound transformation. His journey from a self-serving capitalist to a selfless savior is palpable, and Neeson's portrayal captures the essence of Schindler's moral awakening. Ralph Fiennes, playing the ruthless Amon Göth, also delivers an unforgettable performance. His portrayal of the sadistic Nazi officer is chilling and disturbing, making Göth one of the most terrifying villains in cinematic history.The supporting cast is equally compelling, with standout performances by Ben Kingsley as Schindler's right-hand man, Itzhak Stern, and Embeth Davidtz as Helen Hirsch, a Jewish maid in Göth's household. These characters and their interactions provide depth and nuance to the narrative, highlighting the multifaceted relationships that develop amidst the horrors of the Holocaust.One of the most striking aspects of Schindler's List is its unflinching portrayal of the Holocaust's brutality. The film does not shy away from depicting the dehumanizing conditions in concentration camps, the mass murders, and the atrocities committed by the Nazis. It forces the viewer to confront the unspeakable horrors that occurred during this dark chapter of history. Spielberg's commitment to historical accuracy and his refusal to sugarcoat the events make the film an essential educational tool, ensuring that the memory of the Holocaust is not forgotten.The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski is breathtaking, with carefully composed shots and an expert use of light and shadow. Kaminski's camera work accentuates the emotional weight of each scene, whether it's the juxtaposition of Schindler's wealth and the misery of the Jewish prisoners or the stark images of the concentration camps. The haunting, minimalist score by John Williams complements the visuals, adding a layer of melancholy that lingers long after the film's conclusion.The screenplay, written by Steven Zaillian, is a poignant adaptation of Thomas Keneally's book, ""Schindler's Ark."" It successfully weaves a complex narrative, chronicling Schindler's transformation, the evolving dynamics between characters, and the larger historical context. The script captures the essence of the Holocaust and the individual stories within it, emphasizing the significance of each life saved by Schindler.The film's pacing, despite its over three-hour runtime, is remarkably engaging. Spielberg manages to maintain the audience's attention throughout, using a combination of tension, emotion, and storytelling to propel the narrative forward. The film's episodic structure, with moments of despair and hope interwoven, adds depth to the storytelling and reinforces the film's message.Schindler's List is not just a Holocaust drama; it's a testament to the power of one person to make a difference. Oskar Schindler's heroism, juxtaposed against the backdrop of unimaginable suffering, serves as a beacon of hope. It reminds us that even in the darkest times, compassion and the refusal to remain indifferent can change lives.The film's final scenes are particularly poignant, featuring the real-life Schindlerjuden (Schindler's Jews) and their descendants paying homage at Oskar Schindler's grave in Jerusalem. This powerful conclusion reinforces the film's message of remembrance and gratitude, urging viewers to acknowledge the past and honor those who risked everything to save lives.Schindler's List has received widespread critical acclaim and numerous awards, including seven Academy Awards. Its impact on popular culture and education is immeasurable. The film serves as a historical document, an emotional journey, and a stark reminder of the atrocities committed during the Holocaust. It compels viewers to reflect on humanity's capacity for both evil and goodness, leaving an enduring imprint on their hearts and minds.In conclusion, Schindler's List is a cinematic triumph that remains an essential work of art and a vital historical record. It combines powerful performances, masterful direction, and a haunting visual style to create a profoundly moving and unforgettable portrayal of the Holocaust. The film's commitment to authenticity, emotional depth, and historical accuracy make it a must-watch for those seeking to better understand the depths of human suffering and the potential for redemption in the face of evil. Schindler's List is not merely a film; it is a haunting, emotional, and transformative experience that transcends the boundaries of cinema.",22 October 2023

",10,"If there's any truth to that old aphorism about great art being forged from hunger, then David Lynch must have been absolutely malnourished when he made THE ELEPHANT MAN. With only ERASERHEAD on his cinematic resumé, Lynch was reduced to making ends meet as a part-time tradesman when THE ELEPHANT MAN was suddenly offered to him by Brooksfilms. To modern day movie buffs his name is synonymous with surrealism and the outright bizarre featuring oddball characters at its core. In THE ELEPHANT MAN, the dwarves, bearded ladies, and assorted eccentrics who normally populate Lynchworld blend in among the carnival shows of Victorian England.THE ELEPHANT MAN movie, it should be noted, was not based on the stage play of the same name, which ran simultaneously in London's West End and Broadway. The script, in fact, was derived in large part from the memoirs of Dr Frederick Treves, and was brought to the attention of Mel Brooks, who loved the story so much he used his company Brooksfilms to help finance the project. In one of Hollywood's rare acts of humility, Brooks insisted that his name not appear in the credits, lest audiences would assume they were going to watch one of the comedic parodies that made him who he was.Lynch hoped to cast his ERASERHEAD leading man Jack Nance in the title role of John Merrick, but that was not feasible. Instead, the challenging part was given to John Hurt, a British actor who'd recently been making a name for himself onscreen in MIDNIGHT EXPRESS and, especially, ALIEN. The makeup applied to him was probably the most arduous for a thespian since the PLANET OF THE APES franchise. Hurt sat in the chair for almost seven hours as the mask and body prosthetics were painstakingly administered to him, an experience he later recalled as the only thing that made him hate acting. Fortunately for Hurt, Lynch scheduled him for alternate days so the ordeal did not tax him physically.Hurt was among auspicious dramatic company in THE ELEPHANT MAN. Top billed Anthony Hopkins was cast as Treves, with supporting work provided by Sir John Gielgud as hospital governor Carr Gomm, Dame Wendy Hiller as head nurse Mothershead, and Mrs Mel Brooks herself, Anne Bancroft. There's an interesting cameo at the beginning of the picture by Treves' great-nephew, also named Frederick, portraying an alderman sickened over the fairground's exploitation of their carnival attractions.Filmed in black & white, the movie opens with typically offbeat Lynchian imagery. We see the title character's mother being attacked by a wild elephant, possibly symbolic of childbirth complications. Shifting the tale to 1880's London, Dr Frederick Treves is a surgeon at the distinguished East End London Hospital. One day,
on a lark, he attends a show whose attractions include John Merrick, a young Englishman nicknamed The Elephant Man due to a severe physical deformity. With an enlarged, misshapen head and seldom a part of his body that isn't covered with hideous scales, Merrick can onlysleep while sitting up because lying in a horizontal position would break his neck and kill him. The mere sight of this wretched man reduces the doctor to tears. I have to admit I was singularly impressed over Hopkins' ability to synchronize the teardrop as the camera slowly zoomed in for a close-up.Merrick is the property of sadistic ringmaster Bytes, the type of coarse reprobate Robert Newton could have played without breaking a sweat. Treves makes a deal with Bytes to borrow Merrick as a test subject for observation in front of his medical peers. After grudgingly returning Merrick, his regret becomes justified when he's summoned back to treat the injured man who, according to Bytes, ""fell down"". The truth is, the scumbag badly beat Merrick during one of his drunken rages.Appalled at the mistreatment, Treves registers Merrick into an isolation ward at the London Hospital, far away from Bytes' cruelty. To prevent staff and patients alike from recoiling at his new admission's appearance, Treves restricts the amount of visits allowed to the man. One exception, of course, is governor Carr Gomm, who informs Treves that the hospital is not equipped to handle those individuals considered ""incurable"".Hoping to convince his superior otherwise, Treves arranges for a meeting between him and a very nervous Merrick. The doctor carefully coaches his patient on what to say, but Carr Gomm is not fooled. To the astonishment of both men, Merrick begins loudly reciting the 23rd Psalm, something Treves swears he never taught him. Realizing there's a lot more intellectually to him than they surmised, Carr Gomm allows Merrick to temporarily remain on the ward until a decision can be reached by the hospital's board of directors.Courtesy of England's newspapers, Merrick's abnormality ~and his unfortunate moniker~ has made him a cause célèbre, prompting an outpouring of visits by the well-to-do, including a famous stage actress (Bancroft). For the first time in his sad life, Merrick feels loved and appreciated. However, head nurse Mrs Mothershead is worried that, despite his improved living standards, Merrick is still being exploited due to his condition ~well....she does have a point~ by well-meaning people who see him as an ego trip to feel better about themselves.Meanwhile, Bytes has been seething over all the national attention accorded to John Merrick. (Even Queen Victoria has shown an interest in The Elephant Man's plight). Already angered over what he considers being double crossed by Treves, and not content to let sleeping dogs lie and simply allow Merrick to just be happy, the sleazy Bytes schemes to get his former meal ticket back.It's not easy for any actor to overshadow Anthony Hopkins, but John Hurt pulls it off with a miraculous performance as Merrick. The sequence where he and Treves' wife exchange photographs of their mothers is the most moving scene in a film filled with moving scenes. When a visibly emotional Mrs Treves tells Merrick that his late mom would have been proud to have him as a son....well, I defy anyone not to have a lump in their throat at that moment. In a Dvd commentary, Hurt himself best summed THE ELEPHANT MAN'S ability to tug at our heartstrings by saying that anybody who can watch the entire picture and not be moved is the type of person he doesn't want to knowat all. Amen to that!!THE ELEPHANT MAN was by far Lynch's most accessible film, devoid for the most part of his trademark eccentricity. With cinematographer Freddie Francis and a crackerjack design team, Lynch does an extraordinary job of recreating Victorian England, particularly what London's lower class East End. Not since David Lean's OLIVER TWIST has the look of industrial 19th century Britain been captured with vivid accuracy. And Lynch's skill in eliciting our tear ducts without resorting to maudlin sentimentality is a lesson to be learned by future filmmakers.THE ELEPHANT MAN was nominated for eight Oscars: Best Picture, Director, Actor (for Hurt), Screenplay, Editing, Production Design, and Original Score. And it walked away empty-handed; not even Hurt's sensitive portrayal of Merrick stood a chance against Robert DeNiro's iconic performance in RAGING BULL. But it was the Academy's snubbing of the makeup men's contributions that really stirred up outrage, with not so much as even a special mention at the ceremony. The ensuing outcry resulted in a Best Makeup category being instituted at future Oscar telecasts.The great Frank Capra once said ""I made mistakes in drama. I always thought great drama was when the actors cry. But great drama is when the audience cries"". Lynch's sensitive direction and Hurt's moving performance ensures that THE ELEPHANT MAN contains a trunk full of great drama.🔚",9 November 2023

Other important characters appearing here and there are the following: John Gielgud as the hospital chief, Wendy Hiller as the hospital's senior matron, Freddie Jones as sideshow owner, Anne Bancroft as a prestigious stage actress and Phoebe Nicholls as Merrick's Mother. An incredible but true story... probably this year's best film! .""I am not an animal! I am a human being! I...am...a man!""The Elephant Man (1980) is a good work, more accesible than David Lynch's enigmatically disturbing ¨Erarserhead¨ and his other films. It has much the same limpidly stirring humanism as¨Francois Truffaut's L'enfant sausage¨ in describing as the unfortunate John Merrick, brutalised by a childhood in which he was hideously abused as an inhuman monstrous freak and exhibited at sideshows, but he was gradually coaxed into revealing a soul of such refinement and delicacy that he became a lion of Victorian society. Someone may encounter this remarkable movie hard to see, simply because of the matter subject: a grotesquely deformed man, though this issue teeters on the edge of bewildering at odd moments, it results in a really sensitive and agreeable story; it always draws back the brink, thanks to controlled interpretations from John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins. But that is only the half the story the movie tells, turning out to be a great yarn graced by splashes of Lynchian touches and a special atmosphere. The darker side, underpinned by an evocation of the smoky, steamy hell that still underlies a London facelifted by the Industrial Revolution. In The Elephant Man (1980) there're several sensitive scenes as Merrick is persuaded by a celebrated actress to read Romeo and Juliet, as well as the wonderful final images. But is John Hurt , the great and deceased actor who steals the show playing the title role under a mound of makeup, and really eliticing pity and sympathy.Excellently shot in black and white by cameraman Freddie Francis. Adding an evocative and moving musical score by John Morris. The motion picture was originally and inmaculately directed by David Lynch, including some of his ordinary trademarks and it was one of the most critically praised films of 1980. David Lynch's shooting is very good , though his treatmant tends to melodramatic, but the tale is still affecting at most stages. In 1977, Lynch released this his first film Eraserhead (1977), being too rare to be easily enjoyed, although not critically acclaimed, was noticed by many people, including Francis Ford Coppola, who was rumored to have screenings of it for his cast and crew on the Apocalypse Now (1979) set. After Lynch directed a stream of visually striking films such as Blue Velvet (1986), Lost highway (1997) and Mulholland Drive (2001). Thanks to these films and others, beginning with Blue Velvet (1986), and including his Twin Peaks (1990) TV, David has gained the reputation of one of the foremost auteurs in the film industry, and one of the few living auteurs who continually defies cinematic convention. His films continually represent his ideal representing his peculiar stye of life and thought that should be complex, and in some cases, inexplicable. Due to his decisive innovation and the weird confusion of some films, he will always be recognized as if not one of the greatest filmmakers, one of the most original. Rating : 7.5/10. Above average. Decent, terminally agreeable and moving. The flick will appeal to David Lynch enthusiasts, as well as John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins fans.",23 October 2023

And then when that elusive reveal of our titular protagonist finally does happen (13 minutes in!), it has the exact same shocking impact that it would if we were visiting this ""attraction"" ourselves in person. Except it's not *marvellous*. It's not *amusing*. It's not *fun* in the slightest. It's horrifying, and it's just plain sad. Immediately our sickening curiosity quickly turns into tremendous sorrow. And once again, Lynch knows this. Which is why he barely shows Merrick's appearance in that scene, and continues to hide it until significantly later (once we have somewhat recovered from seeing his unfortunately horrific sight). The thing with this though, is that it had been so long that we had sort of forgotten what he even looked like (especially since it was a very dim lit setting). So when the nurse opens that door and gets the fright of her life, so do we, once again. And it causes just as powerful a reaction - if not more - for us as it did last time. But what Lynch manages to do this time around is he instantly get rid of that barrier of fear between the audience and Merrick. And we realise this in a rather strange way when we see the main character a minute or two later and suddenly, we feel oddly comfortable seeing him on the screen, and just how Treves was when he first brought John into his office, we soon become extremely intrigued by his condition. It's like we are watching this story unfold through the lens of Treves, expect much more slowly, and that helps us, as people from a much different era, to fully understand the perspective of a person from the Victorian era, and what their first encounters with an oddity such as John would've been - and were - like. It is an absolute masterclass from the legendary David Lynch ladies and gentlemen.I would've spent more time writing about the exceptional cast and other noteworthy positives but I've basically ran out of time, but all in all, it's a tremendous picture, my favourite Lynch film way ahead of Blue Velvet (1986). If you're a David Lynch fan and you somehow haven't checked out this masterpiece yet, what are you waiting for?",28 August 2023

",9,"I have not seen many of John Lynch's movie, but can't imagine any other topping his effort here in ""The Elephant Man"". Based on a true story it was not too long ago that humans were were despicably ignorant. During the mid-to-late 1800s was a transitory time for knowledge, and yet Lynch's setting delves into cruelty of the mob and commoners lashing out screaming, crying, yelling, laughing at that which they cannot wrap their heads around, in this case a poor soul aghast physically. But then the cruelty gets even baser involving loathing, beatings, and greed. Counter that with love and compassion from those trying to care for his incurable condition, the dichotomy is stark. Hopkins character Treves knows his sympathy is only a starting point - and shows a paternalistic warmth toward John Merrick. Lynch,his cast and production team were rightfully up for several Oscars. Both Hopkins and Hurt were outstanding, with nice support Bancroft, Gielgud and Freddie Jones. Hurt gives a child-like nuanced performance which feels right and innocent. Great settings and costumes, and a smart choice to remove color for the movie. One of the best movies of the 80s certainly. A tortured and sad life examined well by Lynch. 9/10.",23 August 2023

A very deep, strong, extremely heavy and unique piece of film. A reflection of how we treat other humans and human desire.The use of black and white, creates this old noir ambiance and atmosphere and really fits to the movie.

",9,"My father always talked about this movie until I looked it up and watched it. It was moving, restorative, and awakened many feelings not felt for a long time, as I saw, in each scene, the faces that exist in human beings. It's impressive to see how the most oppressed are sometimes the most tender and sensible, while the prejudices wander around without bothering to find out why. An excellent movie, without a doubt!A complete movie! Fantastic performances by John Hurt, which earned him an Oscar nomination that year, and Anthony Hopkins, whose performance also deserved a nomination, but the academy forgot about him, beautiful photography and spectacular editing, a magnificent script that deserved not only to have been nominated for an Oscar, but to have won, an unforgettable soundtrack that is still remembered today in other films! This movie left its mark on the lives of many in 1980 and to this day thrills cinephiles on duty!!!",18 August 2023

",8,"Three people who did an exquisite job. John Hurt, Anthony Hopkins, David Lynch.David Lynch set the perfect mood, especially in the beginning. Anthony Hopkins, loving considerate human being. John Hurt, what can you say about him? He made you compassionate about a mutilated man with that amazing performance.I was really disturbed by the man's appearance and especially his sound while he talked. I personally dislike when someone talks in that way, I almost gaged. But amazing acting and the story even though disturbing it's very emotional how people have treated him. Society doesn't look into someone's heart or education or enlightenment. Just appearance. How cruel and judgmental they become just by the looks of someone. Also how they would pay whatever to watch someone get his heart broke in a stage.Loved the bathroom scene, despite his social anxiety and fear of contacting other people and all the trauma caused to him he exploded.All of that self-expression because one doctor treated him like a decent human being not a freak. Also, another scene that melted my heart is in the theatre when the actor called him ""my very dear friend"" this sentence has its deep sense of meaning. Both of those people were able to detach their emotion toward his gruesome looks and treat him with their heart. True showcase of how society it divided, yes there is too many cruelty but some people are decent.Amazing choice doing it in black and white with many excellent shots by Lynch! Absolutely worth the watch!",15 August 2023
